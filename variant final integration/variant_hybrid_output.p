It is currently introduced as a completely built in unit (CBU) and is made available in one variant only. This sports cars front axle is equipped with an electric motor, whereas its rear one is fitted with a 1.5-litre petrol engine. The combination of these two engines help the vehicle to give away a peak mileage of 47.5 Kmpl, which is better than any other four wheeler in the automobile segment. With purely electric driving mode, this vehicle can achieve a top speed of 120 Kmpl owing to its eDrive technology. Its electric motor is further accompanied by a 5.2kWh battery, which takes about 2.5 hrs to get fully charged. However, with the help of BMW Wallbox charger, this time period goes down to less than two hours. Beside innovation technology, ultra-modern exterior and interior styling is the main highlight of BMW i8 Hybrid. Both its outside and inside styling represents the layered principle and is further highlighted by blue accents all round. At the same time, the elegant LED lighting pattern enhances its dynamic appeal.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis newly launched sports car has a new design language based on layered principle adapted by the company.

VVolvo XC90 D5 Inscription review\u000a  The all new Volvo XC 90 is the latest entrant in the huge automobile market of India. It is a sports utility vehicle available in two variants of which, Volvo XC 90 D5 Inscription is the top end trim. This particular variant is bestowed with some interesting aspects such as the air quality system, heated front seats as well as panoramic sun roof that is power operated. Besides these, it also has ticket holder, grocery bag holder, cup holders and a few other such utility aspects that enhances the level of convenience. All the well cushioned seats in the cabin are covered with premium Nappa leather upholstery. Headrests in the rear can be power folded, while the memory function to front seats are a major advantage. The entire cabin looks simply elegant with an attractive color scheme, whereas the linear walnut décor inlays gives luxurious feel. Moreover, the extensive use of high quality leather for gear lever knob, and steering wheel further makes it look quite classy. On the safety front, this trim comes with whiplash protection for front seats, hill descent control, ABS, child safety locks and a few more in the list. What powers this robust vehicle is a 2.0-litre diesel engine, which displaces 1969cc and delivers an excellent performance besides giving a decent fuel economy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VToyota Camry 2.5 G review\u000a  Toyota Kirloskar Motor has finally launched the facelifted version of its luxury sedan Camry in the car market. It comes with major cosmetic updates but the company has not made any changes to its technical specifications. Its petrol variant is christened as Toyota Camry 2.5 G , which is now more attractive. Its exteriors get a lot of chrome touch, which is a big plus point. Other updated features include a big muscular bumper with chrome insert, a large chrome outlined air dam, a new set of fog lamps and new tail light cluster with energy efficient LED design. Its headlight cluster also get chiseled and incorporated with LED lighting. At the same time, the flared up wheel arches are fitted with a brand new set of alloy wheels that changes the look of its side profile. Not only this, the company has made a lot of significant changes to its internal cabin as well, which gives it a modish appearance. The list includes a new instrument cluster, blue mood lighting, subtle revision to the dashboard, a hi-resolution screen for the touchscreen infotainment system and it also gets a digital display between the meters. This facelifted version is also available in new upholstery, which is in a swish beige color scheme. In terms of technical specification, it is fitted with the same 2.5-litre engine, which comes with a displacement capacity of 2494cc. This power plant is coupled with a six speed automatic transmission gear box, which helps in delivering 178.5bhp of power output in combination with a commanding torque of 233Nm. The braking mechanism is further augmented by anti lock braking system along with electronic brake force distribution and brake assist. It is also equipped with vehicle stability along with traction control and hill start assist function. All these features add together makes it one of the safest and modern looking sedans in its segment. It will compete with the likes of Skoda Superb, Audi A3 and others in this segment. On the other hand, the company is selling this model series with a standard warranty of three years or 100000 Kilometers, whichever is earlier. At the same time, the buyers can extend this period by one or two years at an additional cost paid to authorized dealer.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VToyota Prius Z5 review\u000a  The hybrid car from Toyota Kirloskar Motors named Prius is available in two variants. Among them, Toyota Prius Z5 is a base level petrol trim, which comes fitted with an electric motor. Its 1.8-litre petrol engine has the ability to generate 97.8bhp power in combination with 142Nm torque output. Whereas, its electric motor features a sealed Nickel-Metal Hydride (Ni-MH) battery and boosts voltage up to a maximum of 650V. Best handling and stability is assured by its proficient suspension system, which includes gas filled shock absorbers as well. In terms of exteriors, it has a body colored bumper and projector type bright headlamps at front. Its side profile looks quite attractive with a set of 15 inch alloy wheels, whereas its rear end includes a stylish boot lid and a sporty spoiler along with a few other stunning features. On the other hand, its interiors are decorated in a splendid way with a two tone color scheme. Some of the aspects inside the cabin include an air conditioning unit, leather upholstered seats, instrument cluster, door trim pockets, assist grips and so on. Apart from all these, various safety aspects are also offered such as dual front SRS airbags, rear parking sensors, anti-lock braking system, door ajar warning lamp, as well as an engine immobilizer, which makes the drive quite safe.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE
