V\u201c\u000aThe Duster has a dual personality. It does well as a soft off-roader, at the same time performs well on highways\u000a.\u201d Introduction:Renault originally entered the Indian market in a joint venture with Mahindra in the year 2007. Over the years, the company has grown to become a strong stakeholder in the market, with a broad portfolio of vehicles. The Duster debuted in mid 2012 and turned things around for Renault in India almost overnight. Now with a slew of new options available in the segment, the Duster seemed outdated amidst the competition. The automaker recently launched a facelifted version of the car. Let\u2019s find out where this new model scores.Pros:1. Brilliant ride quality. Glides over irregularities on tarmac.2. AWD variant can take on uneven terrain with ease. 210mm of ground clearance is adequate for most soft-roading jaunts. 3. Highway manners remain one of the best in it\u2019s class. Remains stable at high speeds. Neutral through corners as well.4. AMT makes city commutes convenient. Efficiency remains unchanged compared to the manual.Cons:1. Interior quality, fit and finish leaves a lot to be desired. The Creta\u2019s cabin in comparison looks and feels plush. 2. The petrol motor feels lethargic and unsuited for the size of the vehicle. 3. Jerky shifts on the AMT. Not as refined as the automatic gearbox on the Creta.4. AMT is limited to the 110PS 4x2 variant. The 85PS version gets the manual Stand Out Features:1. Features India\u2019s only 6-speed AMT. It is the first AMT in India to be paired with features like cruise control and hill assist.2. Only compact SUV to feature AWD. Neither the Creta nor the Terrano offer a 4WD variant.Exterior:\u201cThe new Duster gets a renewed look that helps it to keep up with the changing landscape of the segment\u201dIn terms of external design, the updated Duster manages to differentiate itself from the previous one really well. At the front, there is the dual-wing chrome grill along with the sharp new redesigned headlamps that now give the Duster an aggressive look. The faux silver skid plate now extends on to the front of the bumper which renders a rugged image to the car. Move to the side, and you realise that the changes to this version are merely cosmetic. The 16\u201d alloys have an updated design, which is quite a quirky offering for a OEM setup. The other changes to the side include an updated roof rail with Duster branding and wing mirrors, which are now wrapped in carbon fiber for the AWD avatar.  The Duster retains the same muscular image with the beefy wheel arches. In a sea of options like the Creta and Ecosport that look closer to hatchbacks than SUV\u2019s, we love the burly Duster. At the rear, the LED tail lamps now have a waterfall design. The other thing that has changed at the back is the new redesigned bumper and a larger faux skid plate to go with the one on the front. The rear looks as clean as the previous version and now with minimalistic badging, it looks even better. The rear gets touches of chrome with a broad center center plate with Duster inscribed and a chrome tip exhaust. In terms of dimensions, Duster remains the same, with its length at 4315mm. This is 16mm shorter than its sister, Terrano. While the two are badge engineered (Application of different manufacturers to the same product with styling changes) the difference in length can be attributed to the Terrano\u2019s beefier bumpers. In terms of other cars in the segment, the Creta is shorter by 45mm and Ford Ecosport is shorter by a whole 315mm. In terms of width, the Terrano again is ahead of the Duster by a good 178 mm. The rest continue to be behind the Duster in the range of 42-57mm.In terms of height, the Duster stands at 1695mm. The Ecosport is the tallest of the lot here, by 13mm. The Duster, along with the Terrano, boasts the highest ground clearance and the longest wheelbase compared to the competition at 205mm and 2673mm, respectively.Interior:\u201cThe changes on the interior make the Duster more functional than ever.\u201dEnter the cabin, and you are greeted by a familiar sight. The changes to the dash are minor and mainly focused toward fixing the things that previous Duster owners had complaints about. The upholstery runs a crimson black theme on the AWD variant and a familiar black & beige on the regular and AMT variant. \u000aThe steering wheel is the same chunky unit with a wide hornpad. The only visible change is the addition of silver bits on the spokes. The steering holds the controls for the cruise control while the audio controls have a dedicated stalk behind the steering wheel. The instrument cluster is a carry over from the previous Duster. The triple barrel designs has chrome surrounds with one each dedicated to the speedo, rev counter and the MID display. The MID shows the ODO, trip meter, average speed, distance to empty, fuel efficiency, fuel consumed and a gear indicator. \u000aIt is the center console where we see the bulk of changes. The neat vertical design sees a piano black finish. The air vents get an updated design and show off a small touch of chrome when closed. The are flanked by red bezels on the AWD version. The regular FWD & the AMT Duster gets chrome surround which was easier on our eyes. \u000aThe hazard lights and central locking toggles find their place above the touchscreen system. The interface gets an update. The hardware is the same one we saw on a slew of Renault cars. The AWD gets the touchscreen as standard. The 7\u201d system plays media from CD\u2019s, USB, AUX & Bluetooth. The touchscreen system has the same functionalities but misses out on the CD feature. The touchscreen unit is easy to use, and responsive. However, it could have been slightly brighter (readability in harsh/direct sun isn\u2019t the best). My only complaint while trying to access this system is that it could have been placed a tad bit higher so I don't have to take my eyes off the road as much as I did here. The biggest change and the most welcome change is the addition of automatic climate control! System gets a hip layout and instead of a conventional screen usually seen on other system, every button gets its own toggle light. The temperature selector is a large chunky knob with an array of lights marking the temperature selection. \u000aThe glove box is a large and illuminated unit. Additional storage is in the form of an open storage on top of the dashboard. The passenger side airbag is housed between the two and gets a neat Duster branding. \u000a\u000aThe front door, on the inside, gets piano black treatment and a chrome handle. A unit at the bottom houses the speaker and the window controls. There is a storage space too which can accommodate 1-liter bottles. The electronic mirror adjustments have now found their way onto the door along with the power window switches. This is a welcome change as in the previous version they were placed under the handbrake lever making it virtually impossible to adjust the mirrors on the go. You had to pull over every time you needed to make adjustments. The driver's seat is adjustable for height as well as lumbar. The driver gets his own center armrest which was a necessary addition now that the Duster is offered in an automatic (AMT) variant. Moving to the rear seats, the same upholstery design follows. There are adjustable headrests for two rear passengers. The head rest at the center is a fixed one. You get an armrest at the back along with a rear air-con vent. The seats are well reclined but the legroom is good at best but not great. Renault is really good at optimizing interiors and we felt that they could have carved out more space. The 5th passenger, however, is going to be really uncomfortable. The rear doors get the same treatment as the front, sans the door pocket. \u000aThe rear has a large parcel shelve and will be used to store most of your stuff as there is a lack of storage spaces in the rear. Moving all the way back, the boot is enormous at 475 liters. This is at par with Terrano but 75 liters ahead of the Creta and 130 liters ahead of the Ecosport. In case you need more room while moving your houses or something, the rear seats fold down to provide 1064 liters of space! Performance:\u201cWith one petrol, two diesel engines on offer with options for an AWD and AMT, there\u2019s a Duster for everyone\u201d Petrol:The petrol mill is a 1.6-liter unit that churns out 102.53bhp @ 5750 rpm and puts down 148 Nm@3750 rpm. This engine is a gas guzzler and feels out of place on a car of this size. The clutch on this version is light and has sufficient low end to move around in the city. When we took it on the highways, we constantly had to keep downshifting and keep it on the top of the rev range to get the most out of it.This version is strictly limited to minor use around the city as it really gulps fuel.Diesel:85ps:While the engine remains the same as the 110ps version, the engine carries a different state of tune. The tune is similar to the one found on the Renault Scala/Nissan Sunny. The engine churns out 84bhp and 200Nm of torque. While this may seem low compared to the 110ps version, it is surprisingly adequate as a city kick around. The engine doesn\u2019t need too many downshifts in the city, and turbo lag is in check. In fact, the turbo lag is so well controlled, we prefer this over its more powerful sibling for driving within the city. As a highway runner, you\u2019d certainly want the punch of the more powerful 110ps version.The engine is in no way underpowered but seems that way when there is a 110ps version on offer. Overall it\u2019s a perfect engine to chuck about in the places where the Duster will spend most of its time, the city.110ps:For this version, there is a new option of an AMT gearbox, which makes it a breeze in bumper to bumper traffic. The engine and other specs remain unchanged. The engine, in its 110ps tune, churns out 109bhp and 248Nm of torque. The NVH (noise, vibration & harshness) levels were really good for when they were launched. However, when you compare it to the latest kid on the block (read: Hyundai Creta), it does seem coarse and sounds gruffThe engine is mated to a 6-speed gearbox. The additional gear, when compared to the 85ps version, makes cruising on the highways a breeze. The let down is the hard clutch which got our muscles sore in bumper to bumper traffic. This is something that we were rooting for will be changed with the update. The Duster continues to be a good option to consider but lacks the refinements that are now being offered by the competition. It\u2019s clearly a missed opportunity by Renault with this update. AWD:The AWD (All Wheel Drive) version is only available in the 110ps version. The changes that have made their way into the AWD version is that the engine is tuned slightly differently, the gear ratios are shorter, an electro-hydraulic power steering and the rear suspension see a better multi-link suspension unit and obviously an AWD system that now send power to all 4 wheels as compared to the front. The mode of driving can be selected from the knob between 2WD, Auto & Lock.The Auto option on the drive selector is a really sensible unit which constantly understood which wheel was loosing power and compensating accordingly. The lock version too works well, but automatically disengages on crossing 50kmph. Hands down, the AWD version is your best option if your chosen path is throwing you a challenge. If you want to do some true blue off-roading, you should place your money on something that was meant to be an off-roader in the first place i.e. the Thar. For us, the Thar is too crude to live with on a daily basis and the other options like the Creta, Ecosport, and other pseudo SUVs do not offer a 4x4 option - the Duster strikes a nice balance between the two. AMT: The AMT is a welcome addition to the Duster portfolio. Developed in conjunction with ZF, the gearbox is India\u2019s first 6- speed AMT. It is also the only AMT to be paired with features such as traction control, cruise control and hill assist. The gearbox is available only with the 110PS 4x2 variant. There isn\u2019t an AWD + AMT combo. The shifts are nowhere as seamless as a regular torque converter and far from the smooth shifts of a DSG. As is the case with most AMTs, there are noticeable shift shocks while upshifting. The downshifts too are evident, especially when the gearbox shifts from 2nd to 1st. This can get slightly irritating in stop and go traffic, where-in the gearbox is constantly puzzled whether to select 1st or 2nd. Other than that, it is a complete boon for the left leg. Out on the highways, the gearbox barely let\u2019s you take note of the upshifts. 3rd to 4th and beyond is pretty smooth and almost imperceptible. It is only when you stomp on the pedal does the AMT seem properly confused. It takes its own sweet time to  downshift and give you the required acceleration. For instances where you need quick shifts, switch to manual mode by sliding the gear lever away from yourself. Pull the lever behind to upshift and push it forward to downshift. Sadly, the lag between the shifts is evident even in Manual.Overall, the AMT is a good addition to the package. If you intend on travelling inside the city a lot, we recommend spending 60k extra and getting the AMT. The long travel on the clutch of the manual Duster can induce some really bad knee aches! Ride & Handling:There have been absolutely no updates to the suspension as compared to the previous Duster. Handling is where Renault has done what it does best and we are happy that they have left this part untouched.  This machine takes on typical uneven Indian roads like a charm. On our highway stints, it drives like a breeze, and would put most sedans to shame. The ride is nice and flat, with minimal vertical movements.None of the shenanigans that are usually found with high standing SUVs are visible. The body roll is in check and the car instills confidence in the driver. Another thing which we love is the ease with which it moves around in tight parking spaces, thanks to the 5.2 m turning radius.The only thing that left us wanting more is the wind noise that creeps into the cabin at high speeds and the clutch being too heavy. Safety:\u201cAddition of ABS & EBD in most variants is a welcome change\u201d The new edition comes with ABS and EBD as standard for almost all variants except the base trim, and we thought this was a great improvement. In addition to this, Renault claims to have incorporated an all new 'CMO10' architecture that enhances safety for the occupants. Aside from this, other features in the safety department include a rear view camera, brake assist, electronic stability program and hill assist. Airbags are still not standard with the base variant in the Duster. Only the top end gets dual front airbags while the two variants below it get only a driver airbag. The lower variants get no airbags. Variants:There are minor changes to the positioning of the Duster\u2019s variants. The major change is that ABS and EBD are now standard, except on the base variant. The starting RxE variant is offered only in the less powerful diesel and the petrol option it offers bare minimum likes Central Locking, Engine Immobilizer, Keyless Entry, Power Windows, Power Steering & Front Air Conditioning. Other features like parcel tray, roof rails and tilt steering are also found here. Moving up, the RxL is offered in all the engine options along with an AWD version as well. In addition to the base variant, you get a 2Din entertainment system and ABS but misses out on airbags. For this, you will have to opt for the option pack.On the top end, you get chrome mirrors and chrome side steps. Another key addition is the adjustable driver\u2019s seat with lumbar support adjustment. All safety features are standard on this variant and the option pack give you leather seats. The infotainment system gets updated to a touchscreen unit here.Our pick would be the RxL with the option pack as it provides all basic and safety features and offers the best bang for the buck.

VIntroduction:The SUV segment has seen quite a boom in India in the recent past. New launches from various brands sizzle the market every now and then. The Chevrolet Trailblazer is a real ladder on frame SUV unlike crossovers that have flooded the market like the Renault Duster, Hyundai Creta and many others. The Trailblazer comes out as a replacement to the widely unpopular Captiva. Can the Trailblazer turn things around for Chevrolet, not only in this segment, but in India as a whole? Let's find out!Pros:1. Large cabin space. First two rows are particularly comfortable. Third row is not too bad either with a roomy atmosphere, adjustable headrests and 3 point seatbelts. 2. Torque! 500 Nm is a figure that is unheard of, even in a segment above it. 3. Impressive feature list: projector headlamps, projector foglamps, touchscreen infotainment system etc.Cons:1. Available only in one trim level. Significantly more expensive than an equivalent Fortuner and Endeavour.2.No manual transmission. Lazy automatic gearbox isn\u2019t too great either.3. No 4x4/AWD variant. Toyota Fortuner and the Ford Endeavour have a 4x4 variant.Stand-Out Features:1. Class-leading 253mm of ground clearance. Endeavour = 225mm | Fortuner = 220mm2. Amongst the biggest cars in its class. Dominating road presence comes standard.Overview:The Trailblazer is Chevrolet\u2019s replacement for the age-old Captiva. While the Captiva sunk without a trace, the Trailblazer wants to go straight for Fortuner\u2019s jugular. It does the basics i.e big size, big list of features and space for 7. Let\u2019s delve deep into the Chevy\u2019s bag of tricks.Exteriors:Its large and masculine presence is balanced out by plush elements. The Trailblazer plays the size-card very well. From the outside, it looks every bit a macho SUV should.Now, getting into the finer details, the front is dominated by a powerful dual port radiator grille. A large Golden Bowtie like Chevrolet logo and some chrome accents complete the massive grille. The pullback headlamps makes for a more aggressive look at the front. The foglamps are tucked away in the lower half of the bumper. They aren\u2019t the usual halogen fogs, but a proper projector setup. They get a dollop of chrome too.The commanding aura of the front, we thought, came from the hefty position of the bonnet, and the sleek design lines add to this effect.By the side, the wheel arches are beefed up for a more prominent look, but you would notice some considerable space between the wheels and the surrounding skin. The 18 inch, 6-spoke alloy wheels don\u2019t look too bad. That said, bigger wheels would have definitely filled in the wheel wells better. The profile on the Chevy is more or less slab-sided. Just a couple of clean creases run across its length to break the sheer bulk of sheet metal. The large windows, chunky door handles and the roof-rails tie up the profile really well.The rear is rather clean. The large wrap around tail-lamps have a hint of the previous generation Toyota Fortuner to them. However, the rear 3/4th is possibly the best angle to view the big Chevy in.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe dimensions, in our opinion, are quite appropriate. With a length of 4878mm, a width of 1902mm and a height of 1838mm, it surpasses its closest visual competitors, the Fortuner and Hyundai Sante Fe, in every respect. It also boasts a class leading wheelbase of 2845mm, which also beats its near rivals.Interiors:The cabin is large, spacious and very comfortable. The assortment of fine materials, garnishes and highlights are straight from the top-shelf. Quality, although better than the Fortuner isn\u2019t in the league of the new Endeavour. The visual aesthetic of the inside is pretty much close to what the industry norms are in the segment. The top half of the dashboard is coloured in black, while the lower half is beige for a diversified effect.The centre console gets a glossy piano black finish, and we felt that it looked just perfect. The console houses a 7-inch touchscreen unit that Chevrolet calls \u2018My-Link\u2019. It does support all possible input formats and the audio quality is decent too. However, it does miss out on Satellite Navigation, something that is present on the Endeavour as an option.The buttons of the HVAC controls are placed in a circular layout beneath the audio system, and at the centre is a screen displaying the temperature. Our favorite bit however is the rotary knob that surrounds the screen. The chrome finished knob controls the temperature - a cool touch! Integrated at the bottom of the console are two 12V power sockets, along with buttons for the Traction Control and Hill Descent Control.The chrome plated gear lever brings just enough glitz for any ordinary day, and most passengers would love it. Expect this to get scratched over time (due to rings, other jewellery) though.The steering wheel is just the right design - feels nice to hold. But we personally found the wheel to be a little too close to the driver's chest.On the right side the steering wheel hosts buttons for audio and phone, while on the left, cruise control settings are present. It feels rather comfortable over time. At the front, the instrument cluster houses the speedometer and tachometer in two separate capsules, and at the centre, you have a cluster that displays fuel usage, speed, battery, battery health and many more vital features.The Camaro-inspired design of the dials, along with the vapour-blue illumination looks super-cool, but ever so slightly out of place in an SUV.Storage space for 1L bottles have been carved out in all doors, and we noted that they are not quite as shallow as the door side pockets generally seen in other vehicles. Coming to the interior arrangement, the seats have been ergonomically placed.. The high-quality leather makes the cabin a premium place to be in. However, it would be a hassle to keep it clean. The wide black armrest comes with contrasting white stitching, and is wide enough for both front passengers. The mid row is well spaced, and the seats were larger than we expected. Every passenger gets a neatly incorporated headrest too! An exceptional feature that we observed here was the foldable second row, which can be neatly halved and then tucked away, leaving far more room for the rear row occupants. They however cannot be moved forward to accommodate taller occupants on the third row. Performance\u000a:Turn the key and the 2.8 litre engine sputters to life with noise and clatter like typical diesel motor. While the clatter is evident on the outside, the cabin manages to cut the noise off really well. Once past the initial turbo lag, the 500 Nm of gut-wrenching torque hits you in one whack. If you do plant the right foot hard down, you will be grinning - that\u2019s for sure! The engine can cruise extremely comfortably. 100km/h is dealt with at a lazy 1500rpm - the engine can do this all week long if required! Ride and Handling:-The front arm of the suspension has a double wishbone independent mechanism, while the rear has been compounded with a 5-link coil spring. We were happy to notice very little bumps and jerks, and really impressed us in the way it tackled the brutal conditions of Indian roads. Compared to the Fortuner, this model has a slightly softer suspension set-up, and as a result, you're likely to lose resilience at high speeds when driving over some lanky potholes. The passengers in the third row would be uncomfortable at higher speeds, regardless of the road condition. But we've got to say that the ride feels balanced and steady at almost all speeds. In a car of this size, body roll is obvious and expected, but it's not the type or the scale where passengers would feel frightened. In any case, stitching corners should not be on your agenda whilst driving the Trailblazer. Safety:The safety department is upto the mark with airbags, seat belts that come along with pre-tensioners, a warning for the driver's seat belt and ISOFIX child seat anchor points. A strong level of stability is enforced with a brake assistance program, together with traction control. Variants:The model comes in only one variant, which is the LTZ 2WD AT. But the company has loaded it to the brim, all features which one would desire. This includes a theatre dimming effect for the map lamp and centre lamps, illuminated vanity mirror, a driver-side armrest that comes along with a storage box, power steering, and a rear view camera that comes with a 7-inch display. All of this and more is sure to imbue this sole variant with the most polished aura possible.Verdict:At the end of the day, the vehicle has its own set of 'wow' factors. But you're going to have to put up with a fair share of turn-offs too. The Trailblazer does seem like a nice alternative to the Toyota Fortuner. If you need a big and comfortable SUV and do not intend on going off-road ever, the Trailblazer fits the bill rather well.

VIntroduction:Mahindra is just the company that you can trust with a release such as this. The company currently stands on the shoulders of a portfolio of strong, well performed SUVs that have taken the market by storm. The XUV500 is probably the toughest and most majestic vehicle of the entire lot, and we're sure it's one of those vehicles that will be shaping the trend a long time after. It is needless to say, however, that the robust machine comes with the potential to disappoint just as much as it has to delight, and we're here to plunge into its every facet to find out where it scores and where it doesn't.Pros:1. Very large and spacious interiors, plenty of room in first two rows.2. Reliable engine performance in highways as well as city roads.3. Delhiites can now buy the model with a 1997cc engine under the hood.Cons:1. The lack of substantial luggage space is sure to hit buyers hard.2. The 3rd row seats are a little too cramped for adults to comfortably sit in.3. Mahindra lacks the premium after-sales service that customers might expect from other brands.Stand-out Features:1.The voice messaging system and the touch-screen Infotainment system capture just what the younger generation today want in a car.2. ABS, EBD, ESP and many other stability aids is sure to place the vehicle in an extremely good light.Overall:The XUV500 is the type of vehicle that casts a menacing aura around it, with a commanding exterior build the likes of which few road machines have seen before. Its impressive image is further refined with a well balanced alignment, a raw design theme and numerous fine highlights. Meanwhile, when you step into the interior, you're sure to feel a tingle of awe at the enormous, spacious cabin, which comes along with numerous comfort aids. The higher variants of the model series bring an edge of entertainment to your feet, with a Touchscreen Infotainment system, a voice messaging system, the Mahindra Blue Sense app and many more exciting features. Propulsion power for the drive comes from a mighty 2.2-litre mHawk diesel engine, which guarantees a strain-free and wholesome drive with the advent of strong disc brakes and a well reinforced chassis arrangement. Now, the XUV500 comes with a 2.0-litre under the hood (exclusive for Delhi) that churns out exactly the same power and torque like 2.2-litre mHawk mill.Exteriors:The large, muscular pose of the vehicle draws a really strong appeal over it, and we're know for one that younger viewers will absolutely love it. The company has also infused a delicate and feminine touch to the robust vehicle, with subtle body lines, chrome highlights and an agile, streamlined shape that is sure to get heads turning when on the street.When you look at the model from the front, you feel a powerful pulse emanate from it. The massive bonnet, large grille and the aesthetically designed skirts bring a bold look to the front, and this sets the tone for the entire vehicle's image.At the centre of the front is a large black grille with the company's marque engraved upon it, and you're sure to feel the adrenaline upon viewing the slim chrome highlights that blend into the black background perfectly. Stationed on either side of this are intricately designed headlamp clusters that come with all the lighting systems an average citizen would expect.The front skirts have been skilfully moulded, so that the fine cladding and the visible curves add to the strength of the front. By the corner of the bumper, the fog lamps have been touched with a chrome bezel applique, and although it's not wholly prominent, we enjoyed the refined atmosphere that the car was trying to build.The massive bonnet has been streaked with soft lines, and this is sure to satisfy the appetite of modern audiences. You catch a spark of true design ingenuity when you view the way the metallic skin of the bonnet streams into the side and builds around the thick, sturdy wheel arches.The muscular fenders add a more vitalised feel to the side profile, and that's just the type of thing audiences today like. The well structured alloy wheels bring another small visual treat to the casual eye, while at the top, the black roof rails invoke a slightly more functional image in our opinion.As we stood before the vehicle, it was clear to us that this company loves to add sizzle to its vehicle, and the chrome lining on the window does just that. The black coloured window frames help to diversify the look, together with the prominent cladding strips that sweep through the side.A glance at this machine is enough to fortify your impression of a well tailored, balanced vehicle. The rear portion is bulkier and wider than the front, allowing the roof to taper down gently towards the front, before sinking towards the bonnet. We've got to hand it to them; Mahindra has done a phenomenal job in polishing this machine up for a gritty and sporty edge. Despite being a large and hefty SUV, its streamlined and graceful profile does add racy elements to it.The large tailgate is flanked by vertical tail-lamps, while serene body lines cut in towards the centre. The chrome bezel highlight on the tailgate finishes off the entire picture with an neat and opulent look.Interiors:The cabin is spacious, and there would be little effort needed in hosting tall, burly and larger people within it. As you take a seat within the vehicle, you feel an aura that leans towards lavishness, but anyone would admit that it isn't near perfection.A tiny 'wow' factor emanates from the gizmos and the facilities hosted at the centre console, but you're sure to notice certain elements in the design that could use better quality. Nevertheless, we maintain that it's still a pretty sound offer considering its price, which is Rs.9 lakhs short of the Fortuner. The dual tone black and beige environment is an improvement from its earlier condition which, we thought was rather dry. The upper half of the dash is coloured in polished black, while the glove box and its surrounding area is beige. By the corners of the wide dashboard, you have vertically positioned AC vents, and we thought this evoked a more distinguished look for the place.At the top of the centre console is the Infotainment system with a touchscreen display and the controls at the bottom. Staged below this is the air conditioning system which comes along with rotary controls that we thought looked pretty classy.By the right hand side, the steering wheel has an eye catching design, and we thought it felt good to hold.The instrument cluster arrangement is perhaps the most stylish element of the entire cabin, with two bloated covers blanketing the tachometer and the speedometer.We had little to complain about in the seating arrangement, and it is clear that an ergonomic precision has guided this. The Beige colouring of the seats, we thought, was pretty holistic, and the leather upholstery also feels good. The presence of headrests and armrests for front row is sure to rake up your comfort level.The central armrest console of the front occupants comes along with a storage compartment that is cleverly tucked underneath.There is plenty of legroom for the front and second row, but we thought that the third row was best suited for children or smaller adults.Performance:The rugged machine gets an equally rugged engine-the mHawk140 diesel engine with a displacement of 2179cc. The power-plant is armed with a variable geometry turbocharger, and this definitely bolsters its performance capacity to a certain degree. The machine's specifications are reasonable, with a power of 140bhp at 3750rpm along with a torque of 330Nm at 1600rpm to 2800rpm. As you start the engine, you can sense a very minimal turbo lag. The drive quality on urban roads is fantastic, and the power-train drags the mighty machine gracefully through your every day streets. The power delivery is linear at all times, and sudden anomalies in the engine sound are remarkably rare. The 6-speed manual synchromesh gearbox is pretty easy to use. The first and the second gear come with a distinctly short gap, and this may be of good aid when you're rolling through traffic, for you'd rarely need to downshift in these close and messy times.Now, for the Delhiites, the XUV500 comes exclusively with a 1997cc diesel engine option that releases the same output as the 2.2-litre mHawk oil-burner. However, this mill comes with a 6-speed manual gearbox only. This comes in wake of Supreme Court's ban on diesel engines with a size of more than 2.0-litres. This new launch will now open the Delhi market for Mahindra.Ride and Handling:We thought that the chassis arrangement was very well tuned, keeping the ride smoother than you'd expect. In addition to this, the powerful construct and wide grounding of the vehicle also boosts stability during the ride. There was minimal body roll by SUV standards, but you'd need to keep yourself anchored when cornering. But linear drives are marvellous at speeds as high as 120kmph, and we couldn't help but get the feeling that the car had been fastened to the ground.The independent suspension arrangement does a good job, with a combination of a McPherson front axle and Multi-link type rear. Anti roll bars have been clipped onto both arms, helping to cement stability further. Meanwhile, disc and caliper type brakes do a great job of containing the car's speeds and bringing it to a stop, and this does add up to an even more excellent handling quality altogether.Safety:There are some strong safety shields for the occupants, including dual front airbags, together with side and curtain airbags as well. All variants come with ABS and EBD, while the higher end trims also get an electronic stability program that comes along with rollover mitigation. Peace of mind is also ensured with a hill hold and descent control, side impact beams, crumple zones that guard against crashes and tubeless radials that enhance control when driving.Variants:The model series comes in four variants, the W4, W6, W8 and W10. The entry level trim, the W4, has a limited list of features that includes a single row LCD display, projector headlamps, an electrically operated temperature control, tilt power steering, a twin pod instrument cluster, power windows and a remote tail-gate opener. Meanwhile W6 and W8 trims level up the comfort with some more features, such as an advanced Intellipark system, reading lamps, an entry assist lamp, and many more. Meanwhile, the top end trim, W10 has it all: illuminated scuff plates, a hill descent control, a remote central locking system, puddle lamps, a 7 inch touchscreen Infotainment system, a voice messaging system and an electronic steering lock. We'd say that the top end variant would satisfy you if you insist on high quality luxury, while the lower end trims would suit people who could compromise on comforts for a better price.Verdict:This is a vehicle that will have a strong appeal for a certain class of people. Its muscular exteriors, spacious and comfortable interiors and reliable handling place it well ahead of many competitors in the segment. On the downside, you'll have to put up with a minimal luggage carrying capacity, a more utilitarian cabin design, some cramped space in the third row and a performance that could be better. At the end of the day, you'll love this vehicle if you're out for a good look, a good drive and a decent price. If you're the type that wants a wider package, then some other model would best serve your interests.

VSome countries have vehicles, which define the entire automobile segment in that country. Though the automobile market in a country has a large appetite to fit both domestic as well as international manufactures, some companies remain to enjoy an unending customer loyalty to their products. One such company is Maruti India, which is one of the largest automobile manufacturer in India. Regardless the model, in any segment the first choice of a customer remains to be a car from this comapany. Be it the exceptionally efficient service centers spread throughout the country or the unending range of services offered by the manufacturer in the country, they have always struck the right chords with Indian customers. The best thing however remains its legacy, which helped the manufacturing giant in not just gaining ever increasing customers, but also an impressive experience, which comes handy when a new vehicle needs to be launched in the market. Being the manufacturer of the first people\u2019s car, the 800, the company never ceased to grow ever since. It forayed into the SUV market with the \u000aGypsy\u000a in 1985, when off road vehicle and SUV as a term were in a budding phase. A legend among off road enthusiasts, this continued to be extensively used by people not just in the regular localities, but also for hardcore purposes such as military and other off road capabilities, where the vehicle needs to pass through some of the toughest terrains in the nation. It is no secret that this company has been a preferred option for not just customers but the government officials too. Though the vehicle was initially offered in a soft top convertible design, it soon progressed to offer a hardtop , so that the off road capabilities stay intact irrespective of the environmental constraints. With its amazing build which maintains a robust appeal, the 1298cc engine offers a superior control over the vehicle and it even allows the user to witness more power. Since the vehicle runs on petrol, the performance and pick up are extremely impressive hardly leaving any room for design loop holes. With an interesting 210mm ground clearance, the machine provides challenging off road capabilities even in terrains as raw as hills. The diaphragm spring clutch is designed with enough strength to withstand high rotational speeds. The entire build from the tyres to the framework are designed to withstand extreme temperatures. The load on the engine is also considerably less in this vehicle, which already has a strong thermal conductive nature where it heats up in extremely snowy conditions. Though high temperatures might not be a considerable issue, the low temperatures certainly end up being a tough call. The maximum output generated is an apt 80bhp at 6000rpm. The various weather conditions this vehicle can handle makes it one of the most successful SUV in the nation which actually stuck to its traditional design.The exteriors are specifically designed to match the off road capabilities of the vehicle. The fact that this car maker created a vehicle, which was used even by the military personnel is an indication at the design and engineering excellence attained by the company. The overall design is offered both with a soft top model as well as a hard top model. The soft top variant though offers a simple convertible design, the vehicle falls vulnerable in the odd temperature zones where the vehicle inevitably falls prey to the environmental issues. The hardtop variant however offers a bolted top, so that the passengers are more relaxed. The entire structure of the vehicle is an innovative effort in creating a sustainable off road vehicle. The front fascia defines authority of the vehicle which is really helpful in creating a powerful image in terms of the viewer. It has a prominent front grille, which was a typical Maruti design that has lasted throughout the early years of its manufacturing. The headlamp cluster and the front grille fit in a long rectangle with the typical round headlamps in the edges almost along the breadth. The basic structure also depicts a straight design for the front fascia instead of curvy structure. The front bumper has a subtle statement with reflector lamps on the bumper, which adorn in the slightly framed bumper design. The front bumper also offers a stylish appeal to the vehicle and more or less helps the vehicle in avoiding most of the obstacles. The side profile of the vehicle is also a pleasure to watch as it demands power and a simple design statement. It never seems flamboyant and no excessive muscle is placed anywhere. The beautiful thing about that however is that the machine does exactly what it is supposed to do, it performs. One of the most important thing that needs to be considered however is the price of the vehicle. The car maker did a really amazing job in maintaining a cost effective design despite not compromising with the performance. The side profile offers two reflectors at each end and the wheel arches of the vehicle are slightly prominent protruding out as an additional element rather than a part of the framework. The entire design, in fact, seems a bunch of bits and pieces perfectly coupled together making the vehicle a real pleasure to modify or develop whenever required. The side profile also offers a simple black lining in the under part of the body to avoid any bushes or rocks effecting the doors or chassis. The rally versions however offer halogen lamps so that extreme off roading can be achieved. The drivers side has a rear view mirror and the spare wheel is equipped with a wheel cover. The front foot step assembly is provided for the Hard top, while the soft top version comes with a foldable front windscreen so that the vehicle remains extremely windy while riding.\u000a \u000a \u000aExterior Measurement:\u000a \u000a \u000a The overall length measures around 4010mm. The measurements of the vehicle are apt and are created in a way that it would be an easy transition to the Indian automobile customers who are relatively new to the SUV segment, at least when it was launched. The width of the vehicle is kept at a decent 1540mm, which again reassures the perfect build and appeal. The overall height of the vehicle is a decent 1845mm. The wheelbase of the vehicle is big enough to fit most of the rocks and bushes, so that the SUV can maneuver through the roughest of paths. The machine has an enormous 2375mm wheelbase. The front track of the vehicle is 1300mm, while the rear track is 1310mm.It features slightly traditional design as it is mostly devoid of any modern contemporary designing features. The SUV though, offers a great build with innovative interior system with respect to the time, when it was designed . The interiors offers quality spacing for eight passengers with two passengers sitting in the front while the remaining six sitting in opposite rows in the rear section of the SUV. The most impressive part of the vehicle however remains the spacing offered for the passengers in front row. The leg room in the front row is ample and since the seats can be adjusted further, the vehicle features a class defining space. The driver as well as co-driver seats are adjustable hence they can be altered according to the user specification. The air conditioner vents are placed both in the corner near the driver as well as of the co-driver. In order to offer decent safety for the passengers, the grip bar handles really come in handy for the uneven off road drives. The gear rod is reminiscent of the traditional manufacturing of this company, which can be traced in the 800. The three spoke steering wheel gives a decent grip to the vehicle. The design offers a simple statement however. Minor safety features such as safety handles, seat belts are offered though the contemporary safety design features such as airbags are not provided which might be a problem for people who would like to travel at high speeds. Though at simple speeds, the relative safety of the vehicle is ensured. The interiors can however be customized to match user requirements in terms of personalization features such as seat covers, the car floor mats, steering wheel embellishments, etc.\u000a \u000a \u000aInterior Comfort:\u000a \u000a \u000a This vehicle's interior comfort is enough to match the off road facility of the vehicle. Though the SUV would not classify as the most luxurious vehicle, it sure does the work. The knee support in the front seats is sufficient to allow passengers to travel miles together easily. The information cluster is pretty old school with simple design and block structure. The vehicle stands out in the same section for working in a minimalistic design. Interiors also comes with fabric upholstery for the hardtop version, a vanity mirror on the co-drivers sun visor, a front package tray and a lockable glove compartment. The seats can be adjusted and reclined based on requirement and even the head restraints can be adjusted accordingly.\u000a \u000a Interior Measurement:\u000a \u000a \u000a The vehicle measures up accurately due to its 1540mm width, so that the interiors can be equipped with enough features. The fuel tank capacity is an impressive 40 litres which, considering its mileage is sufficient to handle long adventurous rides.Itfeatures a G13BB Multi point fuel injection engine, which runs on petrol. The engine also has 16-valves and four cylinders, which gives an estimate about the pick up of the vehicle. It undoubtedly has a powerful engine, but the machinery is further enhanced by the five speed transmission, which has a two speed transfer. This vehicle goes from 0\u2013100 Kmph in just about 16.4 seconds.This machine features a SOHC, MPFI engine which has a displacement of 1298cc. The in-line engine also succeeded in offering four cylinders and 16 valves, so the vehicle offers superior power. The four wheel drive just amplifies the overall performance of the engine. The engine actually is more powerful than it seems with an amazing maximum output of 80bhp at 6000rpm, while the torque is also a sufficient 103Nm at 4500rpm. The 5.1 meter turning radius of the vehicle signifies the vehicle\u2019s performance even in off roads. The engine is capable of producing a city mileage of 8.45 Kmpl and the same increases significantly on highways to about 11.96 Kmpl.Equipped with a powerful G13B MPFI engine, which has 16-valves and runs on petrol. With four cylinders in the vehicle, the mileage of the vehicle is expected to be slightly low, but this machine features an impressive 11.96 Kmpl mileage on highway, while the same comes down to 8.45 Kmpl for the city roads. With a displacement of 1298cc, the vehicle is capable of handling better fuel usage, so that excessive fuel is not burnt unnecessarily.

This engine offers a maximum output of 80bhp at 6000rpm, while the maximum torque hits 103Nm at 4500rpm. The G13BB Multi Point Fuel Injection engine has 16-valves, which never fails to perform. The vehicle is more prominent in off roading probably due to its four wheel drive mechanism. The four wheel drive works effectively for the roads as well as the uneven terrains. The effectiveness of the power is evident in the way it handles it despite the issues of bushes and rocks. The way vehicles travels on the the upward direction such as on hills and other terrains is really impressive, thanks to its adequate power.Though it does not offer the accessories of a luxury vehicle but it can still offer a decent interior accessory set. With a simple interior build the accessories and stereos are certainly something, which can be delectable. The simple stereo system might be available with a few authorized dealers.It offers a decent braking ability which along with its four wheel drive acts perfectly in maintaining the off roading of the SUV. The front section of the vehicle offers disc brakes while the rear offers drum brakes. These effectively offer a sufficient off road capability for the vehicle.It offers a very powerful and satisfactory handling. The front section of the vehicle offers leaf spring with double action damper with boaster suspension and the rear also offers the same performance.

VIntroduction\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHyundai Xcent has big shoes to fill in after being named the official successor of the Hyundai Accent. The Accent has been in production for around a decade - a successor was inevitable. More so, since the sales are off and the competition is getting ahead. But Hyundai made all the right moves and even got the next car named similarly to keep up the continuity in our minds. Clever indeed.Pros1. Good looking compact sedan, all-pleasing design.2. Best-in-class build quality and interiors.3. Neutral handling and comfortable ride quality.Cons1.Handling not for enthusiasts.2. Rear seats good for only two people; third will be a tight fit. Stand out features1. Best-in-class boot space (407 liters).2. Chilled glovebox, rear-ac vents - good to have features at the price point. Exterior\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHyundai has done an excellent job of converting a hatchback, Grand i10 into a sedan, the Xcent. The boot has been seamlessly integrated into the body, which seems to be a challenge in the compact sedan segment. Especially in the case of converting a hatchback into a sedan for the obvious cost cutting reasons. The Xcent, just like the Grand i10, is longer than its European version.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe front of the Hyundai Xcent is a colour copy of the Grand i10. You get the same face but the hexagonal grille now gets a chrome surround around the air dam. The swept back headlamps and the fog lamps are neatly designed.To the side, there\u2019s the same silhouette as the Grand i10 till the B-pillar. A sharp crease joins the door handles to the tail lamps while a black moulding through the waist adds as a safety aid keeping away the scratches through tighter parking spots. As we move closer to the C-pillar, the differences begin with a different rear door and then there\u2019s the boot. The roof rails that made their presence known in the Grand i10 take a leave of absence here. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe three quarter profile of the Xcent displays the contemporary design of the sedan styling. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAt the back, the wrap-around tail lamps look neat while the rear bumper looks meaty. Some may take the rear styling of the Xcent to be too simple. The parking sensors are body coloured in the Xcent while the reflectors in the rear bumper are different from the Grand i10. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe top end variants get dual tone diamond cut 15-inch alloy wheels while the lesser variants get 14-inch ones. The 15-inch alloy wheels look good adding a touch of style to the exteriors. Other features include chrome finished door handles, ORVM mounted turn-indicators, chrome number plate garnish, stubby radio antenna at the rear etc. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInteriorsHop inside the Xcent and it\u2019s the same layout as the Grand i10 and it\u2019s good. These interiors are amongst  the best in the business. The quality of the materials and the way the parts are put together match the cars from a segment above. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe interiors get a black and beige treatment, which seems to be norms these days. The interiors are airy with the full beige seats and the cabin feels spacious.  \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe steering is sized just right and feels premium to hold. The steering mounted controls are neatly laid, good on size and easy to access.  \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor the instrument cluster, a big speedometer in the middle takes the spotlight with a half-moon tacho to the left and two dials for engine temperature and fuel level to the right. There is also a multi-information display below showing the odometer, two trip meters and other useful information while distance to empty meter is sorely missed.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe centre console gets an entertainment system on the top with two circular AC vents to either side. The 2-DIN integrated system supports radio, MP3, CD, USB, Aux-in and Bluetooth connectivity and also has a 1 GB internal memory for all your music needs.The bottom of the centre console gets the automatic climate control setup on the top variant. This is an upgrade over the Grand i10.Storage space comes in the form of bottle holders on all the doors, cup holders in the middle, fairly spacious glove box and other nips and knacks. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe front seats are very comfortable with amazing under thigh support but the integrated headrests continue to probe our complaining cells again from the Grand i10.\u000aAt the rear, two people can travel comfortably but fitting in a third person will make things a bit uncomfortable. This can be attributed  to the narrower width of the Xcent when compared to the competition. But the Xcent more than compensates that in the boot space, which is a segment-leading 407 liters. Absence of rear folding seats limits the cargo space to the boot alone.PerformanceHyundai Xcent is available in both petrol and diesel versions. A 1.2-litre engine powers the petrol Xcent while a 1.1-litre pot drives the diesel Xcent.  Both the units are carried over from the Grand i10. The petrol gets the option of a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic gearbox, the diesel version gets only the 5-speed manual. The fuel economy is rated at 19.10 kmpl for the petrol and 24.4 kmpl for the diesel as test by ARAI. The figures are not segment leading in either case but they will do.Xcent PetrolThe petrol Xcent makes a maximum power of 82 bhp at 6000 rpm and maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4000 rpm. The petrol engine is extremely smooth, high on refinement and offers flawless power delivery. Low end torque delivery is smooth, the mid range is very good and on the highway, the petrol engine easily quips the diesel one easily, especially when you have to overtake. The gearbox shifts into positions nice and easy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aXcent DieselThe 1.1-litre 2nd Gen U2 diesel engine made its debut with the Grand and makes a maximum power of 70 bhp at 4000 rpm and a peak torque of 160 Nm at 1500-2750 rpm. The 3-cylinder is weaker than the competition but the drivability is good enough for hassle free city commute. Linear power delivery ensures clean power output while the turbo lag is kept to the minimum. As told earlier, the diesel engine is no highway charmer, failing to put in any horses past 3700 rpm.Ride and HandlingAs is the Grand i10, the Xcent too has been tuned for ride comfort over handling. So, while you can go on driving over speed bumps and irregular roads with minimum disturbances, don\u2019t expect the Xcent to get enthusiastic around the corners or curves. Overall, the handling of the car will neither surprise you nor excite. The steering, typical of Hyundais is feather light. It is an absolute boon inside the city. However, it feels dead out on the highway. There is next to no feedback from the steering and the sense of vagueness will often turn into nervousness at triple digit speeds.Safety\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aHyundai Xcent comes with the ABS standard on all variants while driver and front passenger airbags are on offer for the top two variants. Other safety features include engine immobiliser, central locking, rear parking sensors, rear camera and rear defogger.VariantsHyundai Xcent comes in four variants for both petrol and diesel versions - Base, S, SX and SX (O). \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Base variant gets you engine immobiliser, central locking, day and night rear view mirror, ABS, body coloured bumpers, full wheel cover, power steering, blue interior illumination, adjustable rear seat headrests, manual AC with heater, cooled glove box, front power outlet, front power windows and internally adjustable ORVMsThe S variant will be one of the best selling variants as it offers lots of features without going much above the cost. The features include rear defogger, rear parking sensors, body coloured ORVMs and door handles, turn indicators on ORVMs, waistline molding, 2-DIN music system, steering mounted audio and Bluetooth controls, rear power windows, electrically adjustable and foldable ORVMs, tilt steering, driver seat height adjust, keyless entry and rear AC vents.The SX takes safety further with driver and passenger airbags, electro chromic inside rear view mirror, rear camera and 14-inch alloy wheels.The top end SX (O) offers smart key, 15-inch alloy wheels, chrome outside door handles, leather wrapped steering wheel and gear knob, auto AC and push button start/stop.Verdict\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJust like its hatchback brother Grand i10, the Hyundai Xcent brings segment leading features, great build quality and contemporary design to its own segment. While the features and build quality will do wonders for the car, the exterior design may come off as too plain for some. The Xcent is amongst the best compact sedans you can place your money on.

This vehicle with manual transmission can produce a maximum mileage of 10.3 Kmpl. However, with automatic transmission, its overall mileage goes down to an approximate 9 Kmpl.Ed's take: \u000a \u000aThe power produced by the Isuzu MU7 is 160bhp, which isn\u2019t sufficient on paper at least when you consider the size of the engine is 3.0-litre.\u000a  It is decked with a diesel engine which has a displacement capacity of about 2999cc.

Furthermore, this mechanism is supported with an electronic brake-force distribution, which evenly distributes the force of the brakes applied and ensures accuracy in the control and offers reliability. Additionally, brake assist too is equipped which assists the handling a little more. For the protection of the front seat occupants, airbags are fitted not only for the driver, but even to the co-passenger as well. This is a sure benefit which is not offered in most of the offerings.

VIntroductionIndia's largest utility vehicle company, Mahindra has been quite active during the 2016 Auto Expo, which has displayed its latest vehicles and attracted most audiences. One among them is the Mahindra E Verito - an electric car that was earlier showcased at the 2014 Auto Expo as well. Its starting price is expected to be somewhere around Rs. 8 lakhs. Only a few details are out as of now about the features it carries and hence, one has to just wait for its arrival and see what it has to offer.Pros:1. Huge cabin and boot space. This sedan is likely to provide sufficient leg and shoulder room besides providing good luggage storage capacity.Cons:1. Seems like it does not get an any update design wise, which would have been an advantage otherwise.Stand Out Features1. 72V induction motor that is said to generate decent power output besides delivering smooth performance.OverviewThis electric version has indeed managed to grab many eyeballs at the grand event in Delhi. If reports are to be believed, this vehicle might hit the market by the end of February or in the early March, 2016. Going into details, this machine will be launched in three trim levels, which are D2, D4 and D6. This is said to feature an electric motor under the bonnet, which is currently doing duty in the Mahindra e2o. As per the sources, it will be a 72V 3-phase AC induction motor that is said to generate about 41bhp along with torque output of 91Nm. Except for the technicalities, it has the same design and look as of Verito, and we can also expect it to carry most of the latter's features as well. It is speculated to get refreshed interiors with an attractive color scheme and modern equipments. It is likely to have a new music system and AC unit controls, while other elements might include a power steering column, bottle holder, vanity mirror on co-passenger side and a few others. On the safety front, we can look forward for attributes like adjustable front seat belts, anti theft engine immobilizer and child proof rear door locks as well. In addition to these, it is also said to have hill-hold and stand-still pick up that will be of great assistance to the driver. Above all, it has been revealed that the vehicle will benefit from the FAME-India (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric vehicles) scheme. This is a public awareness initiative by the Government of India for promoting the use of electric and hybrid vehicles.Background & EvolutionRenault Logan, which was first launched in 2007, became Mahindra Verito post the joint venture between these two companies has come to an end in 2010. Verito carried the Mahindra's badge and emblem and even continued with the same styling elements as in Logan. It features the same Renault drive train with the option of diesel and petrol motors. Now, the company has come up with an electric version of this sedan, which has been recently unveiled at the Delhi's Auto Expo.ExteriorE-Verito is just the greener version of Mahindra's sedan, which has the same design and styling elements. Except for the attractive graphics on the sides and electric badge in the rear, nothing new can be expected in this latest model. It is rumored that the exterior dimensions of both the versions are same. As per the sources, it will have a total length of 4277mm along with a width and height of 1740mm and 1540mm respectively. As for the wheelbase, it might measure around 2630mm, which is good enough indeed.Its front fascia quite simple in terms of looks, but the bold radiator grille with chrome garnish adds some style to it. The grille features vertical slats, while the company's insignia is positioned exactly at its center.\u000aThe headlight cluster seems pretty good and large in the pictures. These might probably come with halogen headlamps and turn indicators as well.Bonnet looks a bit plain, whereas the windscreen is pretty large in size with a couple of wipers integrated to it.Its side profile looks a bit different and indeed better than the fuel based version. No doubt, it is because of the attractive body graphics on doors that is adding to its style quotient.According to some reports, it will get a set of 14 inch, ten spoke styled alloy wheels probably for the top spec range. It is also being rumored to be offered with low rolling resistance tubeless tyres of size 185/70 R14.Also seen on its sides are the well designed outside rear view mirrors that may not have side turn indicators even in the top end models.In the rear, the e-Verito badge is noticed on the top right side of the boot lid. A thick strip with fine chrome plating sits above the license plate thus, giving it a trendy look. Looks like the taillight cluster appears in conventional design, while the bumper too is similar as in the other version. Besides these, it may come with ample boot space, which might measure around 510 liters.On the whole, this sedan seems interesting with good body graphics and styling elements that may enhance its overall exterior appeal.InteriorAccording to the few pictures that have surfaced online, its interiors looks quite similar to that of the Verito. The design elements, styling and even the set up seems the same. The plastic materials used inside seems to be of fine quality, while the seats might get the fabric upholstery.The dashboard is seen housing a three spoke steering wheel with the prominent company's logo embossed in the center. In the images, we can also notice the air vents in circular shape and a stylish center console fitted with an air conditioning unit and a music system as well. Also, present on the console are two cup holders, while the glove box compartment looks good enough to place important things at hand. This machine is likely to get power windows whose controls are positioned on the door's armrest.Talking about the entertainment factor, it might be incorporated with an updated music system, which may include an MP3 player, speakers and auxiliary input options. Apart from these, other things that we can expect in the cabin include passenger side vanity mirror, front door map pockets, instrument panel     and a few other such aspects.\u000a\u000aPerformanceElectric MotorThe upcoming Mahindra E Verito, which is already being regarded as a 100 percent zero emission green vehicle, is said to have a 72V, 3-phase AC induction motor, which powers the e2o as well. It is anticipated to produce a maximum power of around 41bhp at 3500rpm besides delivering torque output of 91Nm at 3000rpm. Reports say that it gets a single speed fully automatic transmission gear box that might ensure a decent performance. It is likely to get the maintenance free lithium ion batteries, which will be placed under its hood. Also, the company has claimed it to achieve a top speed of about 86 Kmph and runs for up to 100 Kms in just one full charge that takes around 7-hours. On the other hand, it is also rumored to come with a fast charging mode that reduces the charge rate to less than 1.5 hours. However, this feature is will mostly be available in its top end D6 trim.Ride and HandlingThe front wheels of this stylish sedan might be equipped with disc brakes, whereas the rear ones are likely to have drum brakes. Also, the advanced anti lock braking system is anticipated but only in the top end variant. In terms of suspension, it may be assembled with a McPherson strut on the front axle and a torsion beam on the rear one. Alike in the other version, this one too is expected to be offered with a power steering column that will aid in easy maneuverability.Safety This vehicle from Mahindra is anticipated to carry some vital security aspects that may provide high level of protection to its passengers. Some of these might include the driver airbag, adjustable front seat belts and child proof rear door locks. Other key attributes like ABS with EBD, engine immobilizer, and central locking system are also expected.VariantsAs per the information available so far, this vehicle may be introduced in three trim levels as in the other version. The D2 will be the entry level variant, while D4 and D6 will be the mid and top end models respectively.VerdictWe at CarDekho, would say that the company's idea of bringing it in the electric version is indeed a good move. But at the same time, it would have been better if, it gets a few more additions and improvements in all aspects. Meanwhile, the price factor may also turn out a setback as several buyers might not be ready to empty their pockets for a vehicle with such limited features. However, if you are planning to go green and save the environment at least to some extent then, you may prefer this upcoming model.

VIntroductionThe urban/compact SUV is undoubtedly the fastest growing segment in India currently. Renault first explored the space with its Duster, and then almost every car manufacturer tried to grab its share. However India\u2019s largest car manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki remained detached from the game. Mid - 2015, MSIL shed it\u2019s cheap and cheerful image and established a sub-brand called \u2018Nexa\u2019 to sell its premium offerings. Alongside the showrooms, an all new S-Cross debuted as well. Now, Maruti insists that the car in question isn\u2019t a compact SUV or a hatchback on stilts. They say, it is a \u2018premium crossover\u2019. Does the S-Cross justify the tag? Let\u2019s find out. Pros:1. Powerful 1.6-litre diesel engine with segment-best 320 Nm of maximum torque.2. Roomy cabin - can seat 5 people in relative comfort.3. Mature ride quality, handles uneven roads easily.4. Loaded with features: projector headlamps, 7" touchscreen infotainment, leather seats, cruise control  etcCons:1. No petrol engine option. Petrol engine could have brought the starting price down.2. Average boot space @ 353 litres. A much smaller Honda Jazz gets a similar capacity boot.3. No automatic variant (like the Creta) or AWD (like the Duster)Stand out features:1. All wheel disc-brakes standard. Only car in its class to have this.2. Dual airbags standard across the range save for the base variant (it gets driver airbag only).Overview:Internationally, the car is known as the SX4 S-Cross, but keeping the SX4's rather forgettable stint in mind, the carmaker has dropped the SX4 prefix for India. Not just this, they have also axed the 'Maruti Suzuki' badge from the boot lid, so you'll just see the Suzuki nameplate there.This is the first Maruti that\u2019s being retailed through the premium Nexa dealerships, and not via the regular network. Service facilities however, are being shared.\u000a\u000aExteriorsLike the S-Cross, all cars in this segment including the Duster, Terrano, Creta and even the smaller EcoSport are crossovers. But while the rest go out of their way to ape the styling of butch, rugged SUVs, the S-Cross doesn\u2019t. \u000a\u000aLet\u2019s be honest, the S-Cross' design isn't jaw-dropping, nor is it outright bad. It\u2019s a simple looking car which won\u2019t attract many eyeballs and no heads will turn when it will pass by. Those desiring macho looks and glamorous styling that made the S-Cross\u2019 closest rival (read : Creta) a blockbuster \u2013 is missing on the Maruti. The S-Cross' front fascia reminded us of the discontinued SX4 sedan. The large headlights and the stubby nose do have hints of the old SX4.  There\u2019s abundant bling up front in form of the silver accents in the headlights and the chrome on the foglamp housing. Not to mention, the  two slat radiator grill is finished in chrome too and  bears a huge, 'S' logo. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a Post the bling elements \u2013 you\u2019ll notice matte silver accents on the front & rear skid plates and on the side skirts as well. Even the roof rails are painted silver and all these together add some subtleness to the otherwise bling design.Speaking of bland designs, the alloy wheels really should have been styled differently. These 16-inchers can easily be mistaken for plastic wheel caps; though we started loving it after we saw the ones on Baleno. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aTalking about the rear, there\u2019s a strong shoulder line emanating from the edge of the headlamp, which cuts across the door handles and meets the tail-lamps. The tail-lights have a hint of EcoSport to them, which according to us, is not a bad thing. The space between the tail-lamps forms a neat little hexagon that enhances the appeal at rear.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe S-Cross, despite of its rather generous proportions comes across as a car that blends in the crowd. There simply isn\u2019t a \u2018wow factor\u2019 to make you give it a second look.\u000aInteriors:Unlike the Ciaz, S-Cross\u2019 interiors carry an all-black theme. Some find the all-black interiors less appealing, but we at Cardekho find it really sporty. So thumbs up for that.  Like the exterior, the interiors also lack that 'wow\u2019 factor. But what you'll appreciate is a fuss-free dashboard design with matte silver highlights to break the all-black monotony. Due to the decent glass area all around, the cabin does feel airy. The textured overlay on the dash has a nice, rubbery, soft-touch material. The quality of the plastics could have been better, especially on the switches for the power windows. On the whole, fit and finish across the cabin is neat.\u000a A 7\u201d touchscreen infotainment system forms the bulk of the centre console. The unit goes a long way in reducing the clutter of buttons on the dash. Everything is operated via touch, unlike the Hyundai Creta which gets separate physical buttons for operating the infotainment system. The system can play media from a host of sources like Radio, USB, AUX-in and also gets Bluetooth compatibility for music streaming and calls. It also gets in-built navigation.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe steering unit is similar to the one on the Ciaz. It is wrapped in leather and offers nice grip. The wheel gets integrated buttons for the media, Bluetooth telephony and the cruise control. Behind the steering wheel lies the two pod instrument cluster with a cool-blue backlight. It houses an MID sandwiched between two large dials - the rev counter and the speedometer. The MID displays information such as instantaneous efficiency, average efficiency, distance to empty, etc. The seats on the S-Cross have been rather well executed \u2013 upholstered in black leather with contrasting stitching that definitely looks premium and gels with the all black theme of the dash. However, expect these seats to get quite hot in the peak summer days. If you liked the front seats on the Swift, you will love the S-Cross too. The bolstering and cushioning is spot on. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe rear bench is quite wide and good enough to accommodate three adults with ease.  Legroom is evidently better than the Creta and the headroom is on the higher side as well. The sad part - rear bench passengers, neither get a rear AC, nor do they have a charging socket.  We feel the rear AC shouldn\u2019t have been omitted, especially since the car gets an all-black interior that tends to heat up. Boot Space is average at 353 litres. The Duster leads the pack with a massive 475 litres of cargo volume.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe  top-spec Alpha variant comes with keyless entry, push button start, cruise control, a touchscreen infotainment system with navigation, reverse camera, automatic climate control - the lot!  Maruti seems to have taken a leaf out of Hyundai\u2019s books and have loaded the S-Cross with a lot of kit. The quality is definitely a couple of notches above the standard Maruti fare as well. Overall, a simple but plush cabin from the largest automakers in the country.Performance:\u000aMaruti did a Mahindra with the S-Cross. It went all-diesel with this crossover, offering a choice of two Fiat-sourced engines \u2013 the tried-tested 1,248 cc unit (1.3-litre) and the more powerful 1,598 cc mill (1.6-litre).\u000a\u000a\u000aS-Cross 1.3 (DDiS200)The 1.3-litre diesel is mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox with power and torque figures identical to the Ciaz, i.e. 89 BHP at 4,000 rpm and 200 Nm of peak torque at 1,750 rpm. Do we need to say that the less-powered variant with the 1.3-litre engine performs in a rather regular and ordinary manner. The same engine, in a similar state of tune can be found in the Ciaz. The engine behaves identically. There is turbo lag before 2000rpm, after which the motor pulls cleanly. In comparison, the 1.4 litre motor on the Creta has better low-end grunt. However, the S-Cross is the more efficient pick between the two.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe have to say that the 1.3 motor does not feel all that underpowered for the size and the bulk of the S-Cross. However, better performance is always welcome. S-Cross 1.6 (DDiS320)\u000aIf performance is what you're looking for, then the imported 1.6-litre engine will surely impress you. The mill promises 118 BHP @ 3,750 rpm and best-in-segment 320 Nm of torque @ 1,750 rpm. This unit is mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox. The DDiS320 is brilliant to drive and has a nice punch, but only after 2000rpm. In fact, if you aren\u2019t careful, you might even stall the S-Cross when you are cantering around under 2000 rpm. It requires regular downshifts to keep engine alive, which might act a bit irritating in traffic.Compared to the Creta 1.6, the S-Cross is definitely more fun to drive. The surge of torque is addictive at times and will have you grinning from ear to ear when you let it loose! Ride & Handling:The S-Cross has a relatively mature ride quality. A notch higher than it\u2019s direct rival - the Creta, dare we say. It isn\u2019t as bouncy as the Korean rival and definitely feels more sure footed when on the highways like a European offering. The suspension isn\u2019t soft and neither too stiff \u2013 in short, very much like the Swift. The car does manage to tackle potholes and broken roads with relative ease. \u000aThe straight-line stability is fantastic \u2013 best from Maruti Suzuki till date. The S-Cross feels stable and eager to change direction, even during triple digit speeds. Due to the crossover-ish ground clearance of 180 mm, there is inevitable body roll when chucked fast into a corner. But, it isn\u2019t as bad as, say a Duster/Terrano. \u000a\u000a\u000aMaruti has managed well to strike a nice balance between ride and handling with the S-Cross. The car isn\u2019t uncomfortable and at the same time won\u2019t deter you from pushing it into a corner. The steering feedback is impressive. In fact, for an EPS(Electric Power Steering) \u2013 it\u2019s quite good. Like most of the new age Marutis, the S-Cross\u2019 steering also feels direct.The S-Cross also gets all wheel disc brakes as standard. Again, we have to appreciate Maruti\u2019s outlook for safety here. Braking is a no-frills affair - the car sheds speeds quickly without waving out of line. \u000a \u000a\u000a\u000aSafety: \u000aIn terms of safety, all trims of the S-Cross are loaded with Anti Lock Brakes and Electronic Brake Distribution. Another great addition is disc brakes all around where the convention is to have disc brakes only at the front and drums at the rear. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe S Cross also comes with dual front airbags (Driver + Passenger) as standard (Base Trim Gets only driver side airbag). All of these are welcome additions and shows Marutis growing focus towards passenger safety. The Indian spec S-Cross hasn\u2019t been through a crash test yet but the S-Cross for the south east asian market was put through ASEAN NCAP crash tests and scored a full 5 stars. However, the variant that was tested had 7 Airbags which is not on offer in India.  \u000aVariants: The S-Cross is offered in a total of 5 trim levels. The base Sigma trim misses out on essential safety features like the passenger side airbag, seatbelt pretensioners and force limiters. We feel these are essential safety requirements and opt for the Sigma (O) instead of the Sigma in case you are on a budget. While the Delta trim starts showing few signs of premium features such as the reversing sensors and entertainment system, we highly recommend going for the Zeta trim as it will give the real feeling of premium features. If you do not want to compromise on the features, go for the ALpha trim as it includes Apple\u2019s Carplay System, Climate Control and a premium leather upholstery.\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000aVerdict:The S-Cross is undoubtedly the best attempt from Maruti Suzuki in recent time. While most of the offering in this space are hatch-converted crossovers, the S-Cross stands tall as a \u2018built from scratch\u2019 crossover. Class-leading features, great engine, good build quality and ample space make it a great package. Though, don\u2019t expect it to act like a compact SUV or an off-roader.It is definitely a \u2018premium crossover\u2019 \u2013 as per Maruti\u2019s standards. With the recent price correction, the S-Cross comes across as an even more well-rounded package.

A ground clearance of 172mm is good enough and its wheelbase of 2630mm will allow room for a large cabin. About 5.25 meters of minimum turning radius will help in easy manoeuvring on rigid lanes.Ed's take:\u000a The interior space on the Verito Vibe is definitely one of the best in this segment. The plastic quality isn\u2019t that impressive and we wish that the Vibe offered a few more bells and whistles too.\u000a  The interiors are done up very elegantly with well placed features, which makes it look like a complete package of comfortableness. The seating is very well designed to provide a cushiony feel by the plush fabric upholstery fitted to it. The Executive Edition is pampered with Italian leather based upholstery, which is far more luxurious and also the steering wheel is leather wrapped in it. Furthermore, it has floor mats as well as matching vinyl door trims that adds to the overall posh look. The rear door trim is layered with fabric that has a smoother holding. Moreover, there is a gear shift knob in leather covering. The parcel shelf is offered behind the rear bench seat for storing a few handy things.

There are sun visors to both the driver and the co-passenger as well. The center fascia has been given different designs for each of its variants. The instrument panel has a pad that shades it from the sunlight coming through the windscreen and makes visibility better. Additionally, for the front passenger side sun visor, a vanity mirror is also fitted.\u000a \u000a \u000aInterior Comfort:\u000a \u000a \u000a The insides are well furnished with an air conditioner unit that also has a heater, which are offered to regulate the temperature.

The music system that is decked into this car is a 2 DIN unit that can support a CD and MP3 player. The USB slot, Aux-In port and an FM tuner function can be enjoyed by four well placed speakers. The rear windscreen is fitted with a defogger that is helpful in foggy climate.\u000a \u000a \u000aInterior Measurements:\u000a \u000a \u000a Owing to a massive wheelbase, the cabin is very spacious. Good head space enables even tall occupants to seat conveniently. Shoulder space and leg room is quite good and avoids friction between occupants. A boot space of 510 litres is very good for planning long trips. A fuel tank capacity of 50 litres is also advantageous.Ed's take:\u000a It isn\u2019t the acceleration that is the USP of this engine, but it\u2019s the drivability.\u000a  A 5-speed manual transmission gear box is mated to this mill. It has a displacement capacity of about 1461cc. Along with the ability to reach a top speed of 145 to 150 Kmph, it can also breach the 100 Kmph mark in about 17.2 seconds.Ed's take: \u000a The drivability of the Verito Vibe is excellent. Lug in into a higher gear and there is no struggle from the oil burner.\u000a  A 1.5-litre diesel mill is incorporated that runs based on a common rail direct injection fuel supply system and produces a good mileage. About 21.03 Kmpl can be expected on highways and in the cities, this can come down to only 18.01 Kmpl. There are four cylinders and eight valves which comprises of about 1461cc displacement. These are arranged based on a single overhead camshaft valve configuration. This mill has a capacity to generate a maximum power of 65bhp at 4000rpm and also a peak torque of 160Nm at 2000rpm. It is skilfully mated to a 5-speed manual transmission gear box and this motor can accelerate to a top speed of 145 \u2013 150 Kmph. It can reach from 0 to 100 Kmph within 16 to 17 seconds, which is quite good.Ed's take:\u000a The Verito Vibe comes only in diesel engine, and it gets the K9K engine that is highly frugal.\u000a This oil burner is based on a common rail direct injection fuel supply system and is efficient enough in delivering a decent mileage. On highways, it can stretch up to 21.03 Kmpl, whereas, when driven in the city traffic conditions, this figure minimizes to 18.01 Kmpl.Ed's take:\u000a The power produced by this engine on paper isn\u2019t that great, but in real world it does the job.\u000a  Its mill has four cylinders which further have eight valves and can generate a maximum power of 65bhp at 4000rpm and a peak torque output of 160Nm at 2000rpm.Ed's take: \u000a The Verito Vibe gets music system with USB and aux connectivity to it. It misses out on steering mounted audio controls.\u000a  A 2 DIN music system that can support a CD and an MP3 player is offered. It has a radio tuner along with an antenna on roof top for better reception. Also, USB and Aux-In ports too are present for aiding any external devices. This unit is accompanied by a set of four speakers well placed within the cabin to distribute the sound equally. The high end trim is blessed with a navigation system with a touch screen that adds to the overall utility of the stereo. It also has voice alert system that helps the driver to give commands without taking hands off the steering wheel. Customer can further customize the car by equipping accessories as per requirement from authorized dealers at an additional cost.Ed's take: \u000a The ride of the Verito Vibe is plush as it built on the Logan\u2019s suspension, which is very good. Most of the shocks from the road are soaked up by the suspension and even the handling is decent.\u000a  An anti lock braking system along with an electronic brake-force distribution are equipped in this series. This braking mechanism will avoid locking of the brakes and also will allow to have greater grip on all kinds of roads. Front wheels are fixed with a pair of disc brakes whereas a standard set of drum brakes are integrated to the rear wheels. When it comes to the suspension, the front axle has a McPherson strut with wishbone link. On the other hand, the rear axle consists of a H section torsion beam along with a programmed deflection coil spring. A minimum turning radius of 5.25 meters is helpful in the handling. Driver's effort is reduced as well as efficiency is increased by a responsive power assisted steering wheel.Ed's take: \u000a The Verito Vibe gets active safety features like ABS, which helps in controlled braking. The passive safety features include airbag and seatbelts for all five occupants.\u000a  An airbag is provided to the driver in the high end trim. This will safeguard from head and chest injuries in case of a crash. Its steering wheel is collapsible and can be tilt adjusted as well. This feature will let the steering wheel to collapse and thus when an accident occurs, the wheel won't stick into the driver's chest resulting in a fatal injury and additionally will make room for the airbag to deploy. There are head restraints that can be adjustable. There is an engine mobilizer that will freeze the engine, if it detects any unauthorized access to the car and therefore avoid thefts. This car is made child friendly by integrating child locks to the rear doors.

Very spacious cabin compartment.\u000a \u000a 2. Initial cost of ownership is reasonable.\u000a \u000a 3. Safety section is well equipped.\u000a \u000a 4. Has an impressive storage capacity.\u000a \u000a 5. Quite a comfortable sedan.1. External image can be improved.\u000a \u000a 2. Ground clearance could be better.\u000a \u000a 3. Disappointing fuel efficiency.\u000a \u000a 4. Absence of Bluetooth connectivity.\u000a \u000a 5. Engine noise can be nauseating.

VIntroduction:Tata\u2019s Nano is a special car. It\u2019s a car that started its journey more than half-a-decade back as India\u2019s most affordable four-wheeled offering but has been suffering from an underwhelming response, to say the least. Ratan Tata\u2019s dream of delivering a One Lakh Rupee Car to the world, very soon, became a lesson in marketing don\u2019ts.If I put it briefly, the number of Nanos sold annually is equivalent to the number of Altos sold in a month. But despite this, Tata hasn't given up and continually improving the product and investing in it. Twist and then the current GenX model with an AMT, Tata has left no stone unturned but I guess, that first impression spoiled it all.Pros:1. Cute & Cool styling2. Priced more than a lac lower than the Alto AMT3. Light power steering & small footprint makes it a breeze to manoeuvre in urban condition4. Openable tail-gate & bigger fuel tank for enhanced practicality5. Powerful air-conditionerCons:1. Sluggish performance of AMT2. Sub-standard plastic quality3. Bumpy Ride Quality; Suspension tuning could have been better4. Too light to handle cross-winds \u2013 Fast heavy vehicles passing by can really disturb Nano\u2019s motionStand-Out feature:1. The cheapest Automatic car in India2. Fuel Efficient \u2013 Delivers close to 20kpl in combination (city and highway)Design:After seeing a Nano, the first word that comes out of your mouth is \u2018Cute.\u2019 Just 3164mm long and 1750mm wide.Nano has quite a proportional design and stands taller than most of our regular hatchbacks at 1652mm high.\u000aThe 2015-launched GenX Nano gets a new face, an automatic gearbox and above all a fresh appeal. It retains the familiar shape though. We quite like the Grinning face of the Nano with the new smiley-shaped bumper. But the same smiling bumper looks out of place at the rear, though it's functional. The plain headlamps are now replaced with smoked units with Nano engraving in it and chrome garnishing around the turn indicator. There\u2019s a piano black strip between the headlamps, which seems looks like a radiator grille and adds appeal to the front fascia.\u000aSide profile, on the other hand, remains away from any alteration. That profile of the Nano has been the same for all these years. Tyre upsizing is one thing that Nano desperately needs because the 12 inchers are too bad for the visual appeal. The ground clearance is 180 mm.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOn the rear, as we mentioned before, gets the same smiling bumper and kind of misfit. There\u2019s an integrated rear spoiler in place, which looks way better than the earlier unit. This newest Nano\u2019s tail can be opened but the way to open it \u2013 is with a key as there\u2019s no remote boot opener given. The exhaust pipe, which used to be in centre, now peeps out from the left. \u000aApart from the regular colours(except Orange) Nano GenX is available with two new colours, namely the Sangria Red & the Persian Rose. I\u2019m not a big fan of Red, so plain colours are still my cup of tea. Also, interior colour codes change with the different body colours & trim levels \u2013 Funky! \u000a\u000a\u000aInteriors:\u000aThe dashboard of the Nano GenX is the one that we first saw in the Nano Twist. It gets different colour combinations for different trims and looks way better than the old model. The centre console is now finished in black and the flashy silver is out.\u000aThe orange-lit instrument console is still there in the centre and houses a MID with clock, distance to empty counter, an instant fuel economy bar and two average fuel economy counters. Additionally, the unit gets a 'low fuel' warning. The steering wheel(sans the piano black inserts & audio controls) is good to hold and has been borrowed from the elder siblings Zest and Bolt(smaller of course.) Aircon is fantastic and works fantastically even in peak summers.\u000aFront seats have a dash of orange on them and offer decent comfort. Though their skinny structure causes discomfort with a tall rear occupant, as his/her knees can be felt at the back of front seats. Comfort on the rear seats is also good, but only for short drives due to a very strict posture and lack of support.\u000aOne thing that has always impressed me \u2013 is the space in Nano. Due to its compact dimensions, buyers generally pre-assume that Nano is cramped on the inside. There\u2019s ample leg-,head-,shoulder-room for at least 4 occupants, if not 5. Also, the ingress and egress is effortless.\u000aAnother factor that makes the new Nano more practical \u2013 is the option of an open-able boot. It\u2019s not a big boot and good for carrying two small to medium-sized bags at best, but \u2018something is better than nothing.\u2019 Also, folding the rear seat can give you a boot equivalent to a full-sized sedan.Engine & Performance:Tata has left the 624cc, two-cylinder, rear-mounted petrol engine unaltered. As per company claims, the unit has been tweaked for a minor bump in real-world fuel efficiency, rest it\u2019s all same and puts out the identical 37 Bhp @ 5,500 rpm and 51 Nm of torque @ 4,000 rpm. So, the only addition that you\u2019ll notice in this regard is the availability of a 5-speed AMT gearbox, alongside the regular 4-speed manual. This AMT gearbox, like most manufacturers, has been sourced from Magneti Marelli.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNano is a delight to drive in city driving conditions. For a sub-650cc engine, it feels pleasantly peppy under initial acceleration and continues to be so till 80kph. One of the biggest contributors for this performance is its light weight that tips at just 600 kilograms. Driveability is great and the tiny engine never feels underpowered (as compared to sub1000cc cars) in the start-stop condition. You\u2019ll hardly need any frequent downshifting when commuting around the city. Even in 2nd gear, you can crawl in slow moving traffic, save for the times the Nano comes to a complete halt.  It\u2019s really checkable \u2013 compact dimensions, small footprint, quick steering with a turning radius of just 4 meter turning make the Nano really enjoyable in traffic.\u000a Now the AMT. While the manual version doesn\u2019t allow you to complain, performance of the auto version is a wee bit lacking. Automatics anyway sap more power than manual transmissions and the Nano already have very few horses to exhaust. Cruising at normal speeds is not much of a bother and the AMT works well during that. However, the problem arises when you try to overtake a vehicle and the Nano at times wheezes and feels a bit reluctant to overtake. Then there is a sport mode on offer, which tries to hold the revs for a little longer. But that doesn\u2019t suit the character of li\u2019ll cute Nano. While the gearbox isn\u2019t best in class, the overall drive feels like an absolute boon in dense traffic. Yes, the sound from the two-pot unit is annoying at times, especially when you try to go too hard with the right foot.Ride & Handling:Nano gets gas dampers and independent suspension at its each end. This kind of independent suspension layout was integral to the space packaging of this tiny offering. If you\u2019ll notice, the wheels are placed at the four extreme corners of the car and seem pushed out as far as they could be. And this is the main contributor for Nano\u2019s respectable road manners.Suspension is tuned for city and at those speeds, the Nano is a great car to live with. We won\u2019t call the ride quality great but the overall experience is decent. It feels slightly bumpy over imperfect roads, especially for the rear occupants. So, for its core use as a city car, you\u2019ll find the ride quality to be at acceptable mark, if not above. \u000aNano has decent road manners, in fact way better than a car that\u2019s feather light. As long as you are not trying to be too enthusiastic, the Nano will never really disappoint you with nice overall behaviour. However, crossing the 90kph mark on the speedo will make things a bit nervous, the cross winds starts affecting. Also, if a faster vehicle passes by, the Nano loses a bit of its composure.The SUV-like ground clearance & short wheelbase make the Nano \u2013 a perfect companion for the Indian roads. The steering direct and feels great to use on the move. Feedback from the unit is also decent. \u000a\u000a\u000aSafety:While safety has always been a point of concern for the Nano, Tata now claims that they have enhanced the torsional stiffness by using stronger materials and strengthened members. The C-Pillar of the latest is also beefed up for the opening tailgate. Increased length has helped the Nano to gain some more crumple zone and enhanced frontal protection. In addition, the doors get side impact beams, and there is an anti-roll bar as well. Having said all this, Nano still lacks Airbag and ABS in the range-topping trim.\u000aVariants:\u000aTata is offering Nano in three trims, namely the XE, XM and XT. Even the base XE costs twice the Nano of 2008 and still misses on some very basic equipment such as power steering. While features like the music system, centre locking, power windows(front) and fog lamps are restricted to only the top XT model that costs more than INR 2.5 lacs.  So, the basic idea of making the Nano seems vanished when you see the prices of the current gen. model. And this is also the main reason behind its poor sales. The automatic gearbox is not available with the base model and the CNG is only available with the middle XM variant.\u000aVerdict:\u000aThe Nano, in the newest Gen Next avatar, is a great offering for someone who wants a small and efficient city car. The in-built flaws of its original like the top-heavy shape, tiny wheels, limited cabin storage and small boot are still there with the Nano and digesting that at a price equivalent to country's most successful car- Maruti Suzuki Alto, seems like a difficult call. But Tata Motors have tried their level best to bring it up to speed with the segment standards and has added Bluetooth-equipped audio system, power steering, an openable hatch and, of course, the automatic gearbox, which makes Nano \u2013 even better at being an intra-city compact car.

VToyota Kirloskar Motor has been missing out of the scene from quite a while now, when most of the car manufacturers have been bringing in either new products or revised versions to cash in on this festive season. Well, the wait is over now as, it has finally come up with the limited edition of its Etios Liva hatchback. This brings with it some exciting cosmetic updates to its exteriors and a few inside as well. This vehicle is available in a dual tone body paint scheme. Furthermore, the buyers can select it from two color options, which are red and white. The roof with glossy black finish remains the main highlight, which is giving a striking appeal to this five seater. The same finish is passed on to its pillars and outside rear view mirrors also. A new set of 15 inch diamond cut alloy wheels are now fitted to its wheel arches, while the sporty spoiler in its rear end compliments its overall appearance. Apart from these, it is equipped with a trendy headlight cluster, front windscreen with a couple of intermittent wipers, rear boot lid with company's insignia and bumpers in body color. Once stepped inside the cabin, its occupants can easily notice the few modifications it has undergone. A neat touch-up of faux wood garnish on the well designed dashboard looks impressive, and the dual tone upholstery gives it a classy look.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAside from these, no more changes have been made thus, indicating to the availability of all other regular stuff. A 12V accessory socket is offered, while there are also elements such as front cabin lights, tachometer, speakers, storage spaces and a glove box to name a few. Those attributes, which enhance the level of comfort include front sunvisors, power operated windows, well cushioned seats with adjustable headrests and an air conditioning unit. Entertainment too is best ensured through a sophisticated music system that comes along with a CD and MP3 player besides supporting the auxiliary input options. On the other hand, it retains the same petrol and diesel engines, which are mated with a five speed manual transmission gearbox. In terms of safety, it is given dual front SRS airbags as well as front seat belts with pretensioner and force limiter as standard, which enhances the safety quotient. Also, there are aspects like an engine immobilizer, ABS with EBD and rear defogger as well, which play a vital role in providing enhanced protection while traveling. This will face the likes of Nissan Micra, Maruti Swift, Honda Brio and Ford Figo. Toyota Etios Liva is available with a standard warranty period of 1,00,000 kilometers or three years, whichever is earlier.The dual tone body paint scheme along with two color options is one of the key changes observed in this edition. Moreover, its availability with two attractive color options gives a distinct new look. The front facade is designed with a bold radiator grille, which also includes a chrome plated insignia embossed on it. This is surrounded by a trendy headlight cluster that further houses turn indicators and high intensity lamps. The windscreen is pretty wide and equipped with a couple of intermittent wipers. The bumper in body color is well sculpted, and fitted with an airdam as well as bright fog lamps. Besides these, the visible character lines on bonnet, adds more appeal to its frontage. On the sides, the outside rear view mirrors and B-pillars are seen in glossy black finish. Whereas, the door handles have been painted in body color. The wheel arches are fitted with a set of 15-inch alloy wheels that are covered with tubeless radial tyres. Coming to its side profile, there is only one modification observed and that is the addition of a spoiler. The bumper has a masculine structure and is designed with a license plate console. The tailgate is accompanied by a small windscreen along with a wiper. Furthermore, it is decorated with a horizontally positioned strip along with company's emblem. Above all, the main update remains the roof, which has glossy black finish.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aExterior Measurements:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt is built with a total length of 3775mm along with a decent height of 1510mm and an overall width of 1695mm (excluding ORVMs). It has a generous ground clearance of 170mm and a wheelbase of 2460mm, which is quite long.Ed's take: \u000a Liva has no different interiors than the Etios sedan. Despite the shorter wheelbase, there is sufficient room for five in the car. The only disappointment is the plastic quality and the instrument cluster is at the centre.\u000a Its internal cabin is bestowed with an improved fabric upholstery, which gives it a refined look. The modifications inside include the new faux wood finish on the dashboard and a premium dual tone fabric upholstery to its seats. Except for this, no other changes have been made to it. The door panels are decorated with fabric inserts, which adds to the elegance of interiors. The AC vent surround, steering wheel and gearshift lever are all garnished with chrome.

The instrument cluster is positioned above the center fascia, which has blue illuminated background. It has a speedometer, tachometer, digital tripmeter and a few other warning lamps. Furthermore, it is now incorporated with notifications for driver's seatbelt, door ajar, and headlamp on. Its cabin has a lot of leg, shoulder and head space as it is designed with a long wheelbase and width.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInterior Comfort:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe car maker has bestowed it with a several practical features that ensures great comfort to all its occupants. Some of these include rear parking sensors, electric steering column with tilt adjustment, cooled glove box, front cabin lights, digital tripmeter, seven bottle holders, a day and night inside rear view mirror and door pockets.

In addition to these, it comes with an advanced infotainment system that allows the travelers to listen to their favorite music all through the journey.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInterior Measurements:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis vehicle is quite spacious from the inside, thanks to the long wheelbase, width and decent height. It can house seating for at least five passengers while decent space for luggage storage. It has a large 251-litre boot compartment, which can be extended by folding rear bench seat. It is also fitted with a huge fuel tank, which has 45-litre storage capacity.Ed's take: \u000a The acceleration of the Etios Liva is good and it is thanks to the power-to-weight that despite lower power ratings, it has good acceleration. The drivability is what makes it ideal.\u000a Both the drive trains have been mated with an advanced five speed manual transmission gearbox. The 1197cc motor allows it to accelerate from 0 to 100 kmph mark in approximately 15 seconds. At the same time, it propels the vehicle to attain a top speed of 145 kmph. Those with D-4D diesel engine can zoom towards a top speed in the range of 155 to 165 kmph. However, they can accelerate towards the 100 kmph speed mark from a standstill in 18 seconds.Ed's take: \u000a Both the engines on the Liva are good enough and you can pick up of the two, depending on your running. This is one department that you do not have to worry about as Toyota has done a phenomenal job.\u000a This is currently available with both petrol and diesel engine options. It has a 1.4-litre D-4D diesel engine, which is integrated with common rail fuel injection technology. It is based on single overhead camshaft valve configuration with 4-cylinders and 8-valves, which displaces 1364cc. It can produce a maximum power of 67.06bhp at 3800rpm along with a commanding torque output of 170Nm between 1800 to 2400rpm. On the other hand, the 1.2-litre petrol engine is also on the offer that has a displacement capacity of 1197cc. It comprises of 4-cylinders and 16-valves based on a DOHC valve configuration. It is further integrated with an electronic fuel injection system, which helps it to pump out a peak power of 78.9bhp at 5600rpm in combination with a pounding torque output of 104Nm at 3100rpm. Both these have been mated with an advanced five speed manual transmission gearbox, which allows the front wheels to derive its torque output.Ed's take: \u000a The light body weight of the Etios and the Etios Liva helps to make them highly efficient vehicles. The diesel can stunt with its fuel efficiency figures. The petrol too is good. \u000a The advanced D-4D engine has a common rail fuel injection technology. It has the ability to produce a minimum mileage of 20.32 Kmpl on city roads while giving away a maximum of 23.59 Kmpl on expressways, which is quite good. While the 1.2-litre petrol engine is integrated with an electronic fuel injection system. This motor can generate a mileage in the range of 15.1 to 17.71 Kmpl.Ed's take: \u000a The power produced by the petrol and diesel versions of the Etios Liva is decent, but the drivability is phenomenal. The diesel has an edge over the petrol.\u000a Its D-4D oil burner is based on a SOHC valve configuration with 4-cylinders and 8-valves . This mill can pump out a maximum power of 67.06bhp along with 170Nm of torque output. On the other hand, its 1197cc petrol mill has double overhead camshaft valve configuration. This engine can churn out a power of 78.9bhp and in combination with a peak torque output of 104Nm.Editor's take : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe Etios Liva gets features like in-built music system, steering mounted audio controls and alloy wheels. The lower variants do not get any of these is like a plain vanilla ice cream.\u000a It is equipped with a sophisticated 2-DIN music system that includes a CD player and radio. It also has USB connectivity along with 4-speakers. This unit even comes with Aux-In socket along with Bluetooth function for audio streaming with controls mounted on steering wheel. On the other hand, buyers can customize it with several exclusive styling features to further give it a modern look.

In addition to these, individuals can equip its interiors with additional features like a touchscreen infotainment system, mobile holder and a few other comfort features.Ed's take: \u000a The ride on the Etios Liva is well sorted at low speeds. It glides over potholes with a muted thud. The handling is better on the Liva as it has a shorter wheelbase, but it does get a bit jittery and unsettled at higher speeds.\u000a Its front wheels are fitted with a set of ventilated discs and the rear ones are paired with high performance drum brakes. The car maker is offering the mid range variants with anti lock braking system and electronic brake force distribution as standard, which reinforces this mechanism. As far as its suspension is concerned, its front axle is fitted with McPherson Strut and the rear one is coupled with a torsion beam, which keeps the vehicle well-balanced. This hatchback is also integrated with highly responsive electric power assisted steering system, which supports a minimum turning radius of just 4.8-meters.Ed's take : \u000a The Etios Liva petrol gets all the safety features airbags and ABS, however, this is an optional package on the diesel version.\u000a It is offered with dual front airbags and driver's seatbelt warning function as a standard feature to all the variants, which improves the safety quotient. In addition, the limited edition trims also have front seat belts with pretensioners and force limiters. The entry level variant have features like an engine immobilizer and door ajar warning. While the G trim has aspects like a keyless entry function along with an option to incorporate anti lock braking system with electronic brake force distribution. In addition to these, it also has driver's seatbelt warning, door ajar notification and headlamp on buzzer. On the other hand, the top end variant has features like ABS with EBD, rear parking sensors, front fog lamps, which provides maximized protection to the occupants inside.The limited edition variants have been offered with a modish set of 15 inch, diamond cut alloy wheels that brings its sides a sporty appeal. On the other hand, its top end variants have been blessed with alloy wheels of same size, which are covered with 185/60 R15 sized tubeless radial tyres. While the remaining trims are being offered with a set of conventional 14-inch steel wheels featuring full wheel covers. These rims are further covered with 175/65 R14 sized radial tubeless tyres, which offers excellent grip on roads.1. Braking and suspension mechanisms are highly proficient.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a2. Glossy black finished roof top looks quite appealing.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a3. Price range is quite affordable.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a4. Performance of the diesel engine is quite good.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a5. Spacious boot compartment and fuel tank adds to its advantage.1.

VJust a few days after introducing the updated 1 Series in India, BMW has again caught the attention by rolling out their 2015 version of M6 Gran Coupe. Last year, it kept itself busy by introducing several new models and variants for the auto enthusiasts for buyers. It kept itself so busy that it has introduced new models in a span of just two days. Among those M3 Sedan and M4 Coupe are the versions that were introduced back to back. Now again, the introduction of M6 Gran Coupe tells the story of this company's relentless efforts to stay ahead in the competition. This latest version gets signature M design characteristics like a new front apron with larger air intakes, M-specific double bar kidney grille, and updated adaptive LED headlamps. This German automobile firm while introducing the M6 Gran Coupe, has also started an exclusive \u000aBMW M\u000a Studio in the financial capital of India, Mumbai. This is a first of its kind store, which is dedicated exclusively for the M Series products. With the launch of two new SUV products, the overall tally of versions in this M Series has gone up to six. All are bestowed with exclusive M Package that includes M Sport seats in the cockpit, BMW driving experience control, and Active M differential, which emphasizes its exclusivity.\u000a \u000a Their engines are mated to a seven speed M double-clutch automatic transmission gearbox. While the newly introduced SUVs are available with an eight speed M double-clutch automatic gearbox. To start with the external appearance, all the products in this series look sportier, as compared to others in the company's fleet. The M4 is a three door version, but it can house seating for at least five passengers. The remaining products are four-door versions, but the M6 Gran coupe is designed for accommodating four passengers only. This model series series is bestowed with an innovative iDrive touch with handwriting facility, that enable the driver to operate various functions of the car using a single hand. There are secondary functions such as a good air conditioning system, an ambient lighting system with mood lights, and electrically adjustable front seats, which works to provide a fatigue free driving experience. The brand is also offering this series with crucial safety features including active front headrests, airbags, attentiveness assistance system, ISOFIX child seat mounting, alarm system and electronic parking brake with auto hold. All of this and more stresses attention on the model in he Indian market.Recently the 2015 M6 Edition was launched with a modified headlight cluster featuring adaptive LED lamps. Also, it gets a signature kidney grille with M Double rods along with black chrome bezel. These M Specific cosmetics have also been given to the X6M and X5M SUVs, which renders a dynamic appeal to the already bold exteriors. Besides these, we can also see the update to the design of its alloy wheels.

This is a tried and tested mill from the Korean manufacturer. This series is integrated with a 1.1-litre petrol engine. It has a displacement capacity of about 1086cc. It can generate a maximum power of around 68.1bhp at 5500rpm and can produce a peak torque output of about 99.04Nm at 4500rpm. This iRDE engine has four cylinders and twelve valves that are based on a VTVT and also a single overhead camshaft valve system. There is an LPG option variant too available that can be chosen by the buyer. This is an advantage which would offer low cost maintenance. The LPG trim offers a fuel economy of 19.2 Kmpl, whereas the petrol ones deliver 19.8 Kmpl of mileage.Ed's take: \u000aBoth the engines on the Hyundai i10 are highly efficient. The 1.1-litre is only available now and the 1.2-litre petrol is discontinued. It is integrated with a multi point fuel injection based fuel supply system. All the variants are equipped with 1.1-litre iRDE2 petrol engine. It has a mileage of around 14 Kmpl in the city and about 19.8 Kmpl on freeways.Ed's take:\u000a \u000a The power rating on the 1.1-litre is good on paper, but even in real world.This series are incorporated with four cylinders and twelve valves, which are based on a single overhead cam shaft valve system. This 1.1-litre petrol motor has a capacity to generate a maximum power of about 68.05bhp at 5500rpm and can produce a peak torque output of about 99.04Nm at 4500rpm.Ed's take: \u000aThe i10 gets features like in-dash music system, Bluetooth connectivity, steering mounted audio controls and even demister on mirror. The top end version of Hyundai i10 is bestowed with a 2-DIN audio system, which has a CD and MP3 player. It also has an Aux-in and USB port too available with it. There are four speakers offered in order to distribute the sound effectively and these are placed aptly. The 1.1 iTech SE trim has Bluetooth connectivity and these controls are mounted onto the steering wheel. Though the other variants are not provided with an integrated music system, a provision to incorporate an audio unit is offered. The buyers can further personalize this hatchback with many more accessories. The outer image can be decorated with fancy decals that make it look more fashionable. Floor mats keep the car clean and leather upholstery can improve the comfort of the occupants. A navigation system or a touchscreen interface can be added to further add classiness to the dashboard. Other features like extra power sockets, coat hooks and pockets too can be added for extra convenience.Ed's take: \u000aThe i10 has good ride suppleness and the handling is decent. The feedback from the steering is also good. The only thing, which we weren\u2019t impressed with are the skinny tyres that come as factory-fitted. This hatchback is endowed with a great suspension and braking system, which shows in its performance on the roads. Its front wheels are fitted with a set of ventilated disc brakes, while on the other hand, its rear wheels are fixed with a set of drum brakes. Its front axle is equipped with McPherson struts, which further have coil springs and its rear axle has been coupled with a torsion beam axle along with similar coil spring that are in the front. It has a minimum turning radius of 4.75 metres, which is quite good for this segment.Ed's take: \u000aThe safety features on the i10 include ABS and dual airbags. There are quite a number of features available in this Hyundai i10 series that would make the car, the drive as well as the occupants to stay safe. An advanced engine immobilizer is equipped into all the variants of this series to further enhance its security aspect. This feature is a mechanism that can freeze the engine, when it detects any sort of access, which could be unauthorized and thus protects it from thefts. As a standard feature, the mid range and top end has a day and night inside rear view mirror fitted in the cabin. These trims are further protected by a central locking system, which is enabled to all the doors including the boot lid too. The top end has other add ons such as, a round pair of bright fog lamps fitted onto its frontage, which further adds to increase the visibility. And then, there is a foldable key that is offered to a few trims, which is quite useful and can be said to be another safety measure. The keyless entry which is very useful is additionally equipped to have an alarm that would put burglaries at bay.This series is integrated with a set of strong steel wheels of size 13 inches. These wheels are covered with tubeless tyres that are of size 155/80 R13. Furthermore, the top end trim, Sportz is offered with a set of full wheel covers, which look quite stylish.1. Price range is very reasonable for the kind of features offered.2. Seats are very flexible and comfortable.3. Instrument panel is packed with multiple indicators.4. Comfort section is very well equipped.5. The cabin area is quite spacious.1. Moderate ground clearance.2. External design still has scope to improve.3. Fuel efficiency is not that impressive.4.

VThe Bolt may just be Tata Motors' way to tell the world that they're taking their age old design formula to an all new level. The company blends conventional elements with progressive ones, and infuses some modern scale delights in their recently launched hatchback model, the Bolt. The brand has a reputation of bringing low cost and featured products to the market, and this model consolidates on the substantial territory they had gained in the market through other releases such as the Zest and Indica.\u000aPros:\u000a1. Rear bench legroom is amongst the best in the segment.\u000a2. Ticks all the safety boxes: Airbags, Anti-lock Braking System, Electronic Brake-force Distribution and Corner Stability Control.\u000a3. Loaded with features: projector headlamps, touchscreen infotainment system, automatic climate control etc.\u000a\u000aCons:\u000a1.No automatic variants. Both Figo and Grand i10 have automatic versions in their line-up.\u000a2. Storage space inside the cabin is severely restricted. Just a cup-holder and an under-seat tray.\u000aStand out Features:\u000a1. The ConnectNext Touchscreen Infotainment system, voice command and other advanced aids are a rare find inside this cabin.\u000a2. The 1.2-litre Revotron Turbo engine has formidable capacity, especially for a model of this segment.\u000a\u000aOverview:\u000aTata is among the well known brands in the Indian passenger car segment, but most of their vehicles lose out in terms of inner sophistication. However, as we stepped within the bolt, we were delighted to see a wide slew of comfort and entertainment features add to the inner ambience. The bolt perfectly encapsulates the Indian middle-class dream, bringing a right mix of style, fervour, function and delight to the table, while at the same time, ensuring that the price tag doesn\u2019t break your bank account.\u000a\u000aBackground and Evolution:\u000aThe Bolt is in its first generation, and it is commonly considered to be a replacement of the Vista, which it shares a very noticeable design platform with.\u000a\u000aExteriors:\u000aAt first glance, any lay-dweller may feel unenthusiastic about this vehicle, but it took us few moments of close examination to grasp the wholesomeness of the vehicle's design. The front portion handsomely curves over in a widely shaped oval format, stretching out into the bonnet and then the hood, before collecting at the tail in a larger and more masculine format.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWe think that the slender nature of the grille at the front integrates into the front element very well, while the emblem of the company makes for a more distinctive statement. The humanity line that glazes the top of the grille captures the company\u2019s signature design. The smoked out multi-reflector headlamps accentuate the front, and the sharp shape of the lamps bring a more hawkish effect to it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIf you're going for the top end trim, you get some additional splendour, for the top end gets fog lamps with a striking chrome bezel effect.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn our opinion, the manufacturer makes a strong statement by making use of the dual tone nature of the front bumper, for it positions the hood and the bonnet in a more vibrant stature. The wide hood and the serene lines glazed atop it further add to its powerful design character, working to enrich the soothing vision of the front even more. The wide air intake section fits in with the layout of the front well.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe metallic skin of the bonnet flows  into the side and drapes around the strong wheel arches. One of the greatest factor which adds to the look of the car is undoubtedly the alloy wheels, which brings a more aesthetic flavour to the build.\u000a\u000aBody coloured door handles and mirrors exert a more harmonious look when it comes to the side profile, while the sweeping lines that run through the door give the car a more pronounced persona. The most energetic factor, in our opinion, would be the swept back shape of the front window, which gives a graceful position to the car's side. This simple factor adds to the sophisticated image of the car's visuals, and it is sure to go well with the younger audiences that the brand aims for. Another element to be highlighted here would be the varying colour of the door frames, which have a black conditioning.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe rear side of the vehicle is wider in proportion, and this gives the car a balanced look. One is sure to be taken by surprise upon viewing the LED illumination on the license plate, and this is a feature that competitors such as the Jazz have not been incorporated with. The flame shaped tail-lamps add vitality to the car's simple design, and the integrated rear spoiler takes the entire visual aspect to a more racy flavour for us.\u000a\u000a\u000aDimensions are proportionate with a length of 3850mm, a width of 1695mm and a height of 1530mm.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe car's boot space of 210-litres lags behind when compared to some of its rivals, although it would suffice for you if you can keep your travel needs nominal. We wouldn\u2019t recommend the vehicle for expansive travel needs, and if you\u2019re looking for others in this segment with a reasonable boot area, there\u2019s always the Figo with 257-liters, or the Hyundai Grand i10 with 256-liters.\u000a\u000aInteriors:\u000a We found the taste of the interior design to be neither too grand nor too bland. It found the right balance in terms of its price range, and the presence of many sound comfort aspects is sure to boost the experience.\u000a\u000a\u000aFirst off, the body hugging seats make for a high level of comfort, and anyone expecting comfort during a ride would feel so as well. Headrests have been integrated to the front as well as the rear, and this improves safety as well as convenience when driving.\u000a\u000a\u000aBut the factor that truly amazed us was the Java black interior layout, which resembles the theme of a sports car. The full fabric seat covering adds to the delight, and although it is not nearly as plush, it is definitely easier to maintain than beige and other more expensive upholstery.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe centre console is positioned for convenience, so that the cup holder and the power outlet within it are integrated right into the inner environment. The buttons on the console have been arranged ergonomically, with large knobs for the AC that jut out.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Infotainment system screen has been propped right above this, fitting snugly with the clean centre console. The company has given the audience the added convenience of a smartphone enabled navigation system, a video playback facility, as well as an image viewing options. Needless to mention, music can be played via USB, AUX, Bluetooth and Radio.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000aLittle dabs of chrome - on the air vents and the parking brake lever tip, adds a touch of affluence to the entire atmosphere. Fabric inserts grace the door sides, and adds another layer of energy to the place in our opinion.\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000aThe instrument cluster has two dials which house the tachometer and the speedometer respectively. It also gets readout for engine temperature and a fuel guage as well. The cluster gets a white backlight and is easy to read. The MID reads out basic information such as Current Gear, Trip A/B, Odometer and Economy. Instantaneous Economy is displayed by a horizontal bar at the bottom of the MID.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000aThe steering wheel by the right hand side is a picture of sportiness, with vibrant metallic highlights and the emblem of the company perched right at the centre. The wheel is just the right size and feels nice to hold.  There are buttons for audio and calls mounted on the steering wheel, and you\u2019re sure to feel more relieved with the operation as a result of this.\u000a\u000aDespite the lavish aura of the interiors, we\u2019d have to tell you that the storage space here is minimal, with only one cup holder and an under seat tray. It is also noteworthy that although the door sides come with pockets, they are too shallow to hold anything substantial.\u000a\u000aPerformance:\u000aDiesel:\u000aThe Quadrajet 1.3-litre diesel engine has been modelled to suit the BSIV emission norms, and this means lesser fuel worries for the owner. It consists of 4 cylinders and displaces 1248cc. The company has wired the engine with a common rail direct injection, while a manual 5-speed transmission channels the power efficiently to the wheels. It starts with a quick, dry rumble and then works out just as soothingly as one might expect. This drivetrain gives a power of 74bhp at 4000rpm, together with a torque of 190Nm at 1750rpm to 3000rpm.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000aThe engine is the exact same 1.3 litre unit that the Swift deploys. However, we have to say that Maruti has the better gearing. Ratios on the Maruti are spaced out much better compared to the Tata. The unit on the Bolt has considerable lag upto 1800rpm. However, once the turbo spools up - power is delivered in a nice surge.\u000a\u000aPetrol:\u000a\u000aComing to the petrol trim, Tata is offering a Revotron 1.2 litre engine, which comes along with a turbocharger. Here too, the BSIV standards are met, and cleaner emissions could be a plus point for many of the company's customers. Apart from this, in terms of performance this plant slackens very faintly, with a displacement of 1193, a power of 89bhp at 5000rpm and a torque of 140Nm at 1500rpm to 4000rpm. The company utilises the same 5-speed manual gearbox here as well, and it makes for efficient shifting without too much strain for the driver.  A low hum engages the occupants throughout the drive, but the experience is otherwise unhampered.\u000a\u000aThe turbo-charged 1.2 litre unit also gets Multi Drive Mode. The user can select between City (default), Eco and Sports. Naturally, throttle response is dull and lethargic in Eco - it is best used for long distance cruising. Sport mode is for when you are in a hurry - the throttle response is much sharper. City mode is a nice median.\u000a\u000aRide and Handling:\u000aA combination of discs and drums form the braking system, and the stopping power was more than adequate in our opinion. We noticed a very slight imbalance in times of reckless braking, an unavoidable consequence of the model's weight. Tata has been making vehicles for Indian roads for quite a long time, and it is evident from the ride quality that their suspension systems have evolved over the ages to tackle the punishing environment of our roads. Rigged onto the front is a dual-path McPherson strut, and its functioning is further assisted with a coil spring and an anti roll bar. Meanwhile, the rear arm is compounded with a twist beam, with a coil spring and shock absorber further asserting control. The chassis layout contained most of the drive strains, with road bumps, potholes and rocks effectively absorbed into the ride. That isn't to say that there weren't hassles, of course. One must bear in mind that mild anomalies do send rustles through the cabin, but the average Indian driver would be more than prepared for these.\u000a\u000aSafety:\u000aWhen stepping into the cabin, an average person would hold this company's safety programs in a weak light. This car significantly makes progress towards the brand's emphasis on safety front. The downside however, is that the benefit of these features are exclusively preserved only for the higher end models. The starting edition comes with a very weak safety accord, with a mere rear door child lock and an immobiliser. Meanwhile, the high end versions come with speed dependant auto door locks, front seat belts that have pretensioners and load limiters, driver and co passenger airbags.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVariants:\u000aIt comes with four variants, among which XE is the entry trim. This, we would say, is for more cost-conscious people willing to forgo more high-end features.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the top end XT comes with an advanced array of features that includes the Infotainment system, Navigation system, Voice command, and also crucial safety elements like airbags, perimeter alarm system, a rear defogger and fog lamps. Along with this is automatic temperature control, one shot power down facility for the driver\u2019s window, and even a boot lamp, all of which are present exclusively for it. The punishing aspect of it would, however, be its price.\u000a\u000aXM and XMS could strike a balance between the two trims, and if you\u2019re willing to embrace some features and let go of others for a fair price, either of these trims could do well for you. A central locking system, power windows, Bluetooth facility, speed dependant audio control, electrically operated outside mirrors, along with the ABS, EBD and CSC systems aren\u2019t present in the base variant, but are integrated here.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000aVerdict:\u000aAt the end of the day, like most other cars, this one has its bag of plus and minus points. One needs to be selective about what he expects from the likes of the Bolt. If you\u2019re looking for a solid Infotainment system, decent interiors, and passable exteriors - this car would definitely delight you. All in all, the Bolt makes its mark in the minds of thrifty middle class Indian, but fails to impress those looking for a more opulent driving experience.

VIntroduction:Chevrolet has made some decent ground in the Indian market, and models such as Cruze help to strengthen the company's position here. Cruze had been received with a decent response in the market, although it was not nearly as good as it had performed in International markets. With the Indian market confined to regional players, and anchored to a selective price range, a whole range of factors fuel the vehicle's less than overwhelming response. We're here to scavenge all we can from the Chevrolet Cruze, and find out exactly where it let the score down, and where it knocked it off the park.Pros:1. Stunning exterior look.2. Host of comfort and entertainment facilities to keep the occupants engaged.Cons:1. The performance could use an upgrade.2. Its price range is sure to trim its column of potential buyers.Stand-Out Features:1. The My-Link 7-inch Infotainment System is one of the few things that truly awe you about this car.2. Its handling is particularly good, giving just about any type of driver the time of his life.Overall:It's safe to say that the vehicle does boast some unique impressions of its own, from a stylish look to a luxurious cabin to passable performance. Chrome highlights, an agile shape and a well balanced profile together make the Cruze gracious and good looking. Underneath the skin, it comes with a mediocre cabin that is treated for a lush and engaging appeal. The black and titanium colour scheme makes for a holistic aura, and occupants are sure to feel enriched by the modern and sophisticated layout of the instruments. The cornerstone of the entire ride, if you ask us, would be the entertainment facilities, from the Infotainment system to the integrated radio system. The machine has been powered with a 2.0-litre diesel engine, and the Cruze comes fitted with some strong safety aids such as ABS/EBD, dual airbags, child anchoring and many more.Exteriors:A glance at the Chevrolet Cruze and you're likely to be left with a crackling, racy impression. We're sure that the vehicle's slender build, low profile and sporty edge meld to make it a phenomenon among youngsters. There's no doubt that it does absorb some influences from mainstream models, but Chevrolet has also given it its own distinct touch with the classy look along with some rich themes.At the front, the sharp face is great looking, and the swept back headlamps add to the aggressive effect. The dual port front grille comes along with the golden Chevrolet bowtie, and we thought this alone injected some more glam' into the front. The chrome flavour of the grille, along with the dual bezel highlight on the headlamps together sew some lavishness into the design.The gentle metallic skin wraps over the bottom-side, leaving strong design lines that flow outwards for a more prominent demeanour.The side of the vehicle is given its prominence with the subtle wheel arches, well-sculpted alloy wheels, and the serene body lines that run through the door side. You can feel a more plush effect permeate the vehicle's image with the chrome garnished window sill and the chrome door handles. The outside mirrors are body colored, and we thought this aligns with the overall look well.The overall structure of the machine is balanced with a larger rear portion, and this gives it a streamlined, agile build that is sure to get heads turning. The metallic skin blankets around the rear wheel arches in a flawless manner, giving a more puffed up look to the back of the vehicle. The refined curves flow all the way into the rear side, making for a more aesthetic, visionary look.You can tell that the company feasts on luxury delights, with a thin chrome garnish at the centre of the trunk. The slick looking tail-lamps stretch all the way from the inside of the truck and expand into the side profile, and we found this design brilliant. The ol' Chevy emblem rests by the top of the trunk, finishing off the magic with a more distinguished effect.Interiors:The cabin is reasonably spacious, and when placed aside rival sedans, it probably goes a notch or two up. Taller and broader occupants could have mild complaints, but all in all, the machine can comfortably house five normal adults. For the front occupants, there is decent space for you to stretch your legs, while the rear could use some more. Headroom does fall short slightly, and if you're in a taller range, you might have to put up with a constricted feeling.Being a Chevy vehicle, you're more than justified in seeking the most sensuous, luxurious appeal in here. We'll let you know that we felt marvellous sitting in here. The Corvette inspired dual cockpit design had our jaws dropping and the premium black and titanium wraparound theme further instilled some beauty into the space.The vibrant feeling you get when you sit in here is further boosted by a pulse of sophistication and glamour. The advanced looking centre console and steering wheel together capture any average man's attention. This goes in perfect harmony with the black environment and the silver accents. The dashboard slopes down from the top and fuses into the glove box at the bottom. Circular AC vents are pressed into the corners of the dash, and rectangular vents flow downwards on both sides of the centre console.The console makes for a more energetic aura, with a unique, sliding-down 'V' shape and metallic highlights that compliment the black colour treatment. Integrated at the top of the console is a My-Link Touch screen Infotainment system with the buttons batched below. We thought that the 7-inch screen looked far better than in the previous version, which looked nearly outdated. Well below the audio, switches for the climate control facility have been stacked, right in front of the 6-speed gearbox.The steering wheel comes with the same sporty design that most vehicles employ today, but we've got to add that it felt remarkably good to hold. Buttons for the audio system, Bluetooth, voice recognition as well as cruise control have been wired into the wheel, and the Chevrolet emblem rests by the centre for a more distinctive image.Ahead, the triple pod instrument cluster comes with an icy blue illumination, and this renews the modern tone of the place.The Monotone Jet black seats come with Titanium stitch highlights does play up to the cabin atmosphere. We won't lie to you, the seating is remarkably good, and the leather upholstery further enriches the experience.Headrests have been incorporated for added convenience. At the front, the armrests come with a storage area and a sliding lid, while the rear armrest is built with cup holders. We thought that the design fed on themes and influences used in modern cars today, but there was some ingenuity in the overall make-up and for this, we'll give the interiors a pass.Performance:Packed within the car is a 2.0-litre diesel engine that displaces 1998cc. It has 4 cylinders and 16 valves wired together through the double overhead camshaft arrangement. The engine has seen an upgrade from its previous version, and its current specs are stronger and healthy. With a power of 164bhp at 3800rpm and a torque of 360Nm at 2000rpm, it notches up 16bhp and 53Nm more than its predecessor. We found driving in traffic a rather dreary affair, and the engine doesn't bulk up anywhere before 2000rpm. Nevertheless, torque delivery is neater and better spread in this new version. Acceleration feels smooth and responsive, and you'd be swept to the back of your seat when flooring the gas pedal. The brunt of the engine is carried by the front wheels, and yet, the torque steer didn't seem too rash or out of control. The engine is meshed with a 6-speed manual transmission that makes shifting a reasonably easy job.Handling:We thought that the company left no stone unturned with respect to the chassis arrangement. The Cruzeâ\u20ac\u2122s front arm has been compounded with a McPerson strut, and this is further enhanced with the a linear cylindrical coil spring and a tubular stabilizer bar system. Meanwhile, the rear axle has a compound crank type system, and it comes along with a non linear mini block coil spring. In addition to this, twin tube gas type shock absorbers also help to offer a comfortable, strain free ride. When you're in this vehicle, you're sure to feel more relieved than in other home made vehicles, and we'll give the company props for that. Subtle bumps and jerks are to be expected nevertheless, but you're not going to be tossed about within the car as you would be with some other vehicles. Cornering and stopping is also a neat affair, with the present of strong discs at the front as well as the rear. We thought that the front wheel drive format of the vehicle was a core factor in the harmonious handling, though drivers with a heavier taste might feel awkward adjusting to this.Safety:The company has made no compromise with safety for the Cruze. You're likely to feel more relaxed and at ease here inside this vehicle than most others, with a slew of security elements blanketing the car. This includes the ABS, dual front airbags, side airbags, child mounting seat provisions, underbody coating, a dual electric horn, battery run down protection and height adjustable front seatbelts. Anti theft alarm, an immobilizer and programmable auto door locking facility affirm the security of the vehicle as well, in addition to the occupants. What really impressed us about the safety provisions was the fact that all of them were made available for all trims.Variants:The model comes in two trim levels: LT and LTZ. LT comes with a nominal list of features, including power steering, a tropicalised electronic auto air conditioning system, an integrated audio system with USB, Aux-In and MP3, steering mounted audio controls, power adjustable outside mirrors, power windows with an express down function, a sunglass holder and a remote door lock facility. Meanwhile, the higher end LTZ has been imbued with a far more relishing air, with a 7-inch My-Link Touch screen Infotainment system, an internet radio function, SIRI EYES FREE compatibility, Bluetooth audio streaming facility, a rear view camera incorporated into the Touch screen display, and touch controls for the automatic HVAC personalization settings. We'll admit that the LTZ variant is pretty fancy, but if you're looking to cut short on your spending by curbing your comfort, then we'd recommend the LT trim for you. But if high quality comfort is your primary need, then LTZ would be suited for you.Verdict:We'll admit, this car did go further than most others with its merits. A powerful exterior, well styled interior, a range of entertainment and comfort features and a decent handling capacity together solidify its position as a preferable choice for many of today's buyers. On the downside, however, customers have to bear an immense cost, just passable performance and lack of space on the inside. In the end of the day, if you're willing to shell out quite a lot of money for a classy vehicle with style, charisma and comfort, then the Cruze is a choice you wouldn't regret. But if you're a more reserved buyer, and if you can trade comfort for a reasonable price, then we would suggest that you head elsewhere.

VIntroduction:Volvo, the Swedish automobile brand is all set to launch a brand new product in the Indian market. It is the Volvo S60 Cross Country, which is nothing but a sportier version of existing S60 sedan. It was displayed for the very first time at the Detroit motor show, which was held in January 2015. It has already been launched in some of the global auto markets like the United States and now it is all set to arrive in India, on 11th of March. By introducing the cross country, the Swedish automaker is looking towards expanding its presence in the region. Last year, the petrol version of the S60 T6 was offered with a price tag of Rs. 42 lac. So now, we are expecting this sporty version to fall in the price bracket of Rs. 45 lakh to 55 lakh. Though, the company's hasn't yet disclosed any information pertaining to the India-bound version. However, we'll try and explore the international version, since the car will arrive as a CBU. Pros:1. Looks like it is well equipped with several comfort features, which will only add to the passenger's convenience.\u000a\u000a2. Expect it to come with advanced safety standards.Cons:1. The speculated price tag seems to be quite high, which might become one of its major drawbacks. Standout features:1. We expect the car to come with IntelliSafe safety features, which would make the car the safest in its class.\u000a\u000a2. City Safety is another benchmark security feature that acts as your co-pilot and applies brakes automatically in case of emergency, when a crash seems eminent. Overview:The upcoming Volvo S60 Cross Country is another breed of 60 series vehicle from Volvo. It is based on the S60 sedan platform, but it looks notably different from the former. This car is slated for a launch on 11th of March. It is likely that Volvo will launch the model in two variants: one with a D4 2.0-litre diesel and another one with a D4 2.4-litre diesel engine. The range topper with a 2.4-litre mill is also likely to come with the AWD drive mechanism. However, the company hasn't disclosed the official details pertaining to the India-bound version. Talking about its looks, this cross sedan is stylish and imposing, with some striking attributes. A few reports state that it might make an appearance with both 18-inch and 19-inch alloy wheels, with high-performance tyres. As for the interiors, we can expect luxury and great comfort from this machine just like other existing models of this brand. Some of the key aspects present in the S60 like reverse parking camera, sunroof, and the sat-navigation system might be carried forward with this one as well. If we talk about safety, it is a known fact that Volvo has always surprised its buyers with several security attributes in all its vehicles, and expect this one to come with the same. Upon its launch, it will be the first car to be offered by the automaker in 2016. ExteriorFrom the pictures which surfaced across the internet, it shows the sporty side of its existing S60 sedan model. The car wears a low and sharp profile that is sure to grab a lot of eyeballs once it enters the market. It's lean position and aerodynamic design will help in keeping it in the best shape for a fast and rough drive.Seems like this cross sedan might get increased exterior proportions when compared to the S60 sedan. Reports state that it will come with a length of 4635mm along with a width and height of 2097mm and 1484mm, respectively. Not only this, it is also likely to get 65mm more ground clearance, which makes it safer on uneven surfaces and bumpy roads. As for the design, this machine looks dapper in all its profiles. However, if we first take a look at its front facade, it is bold and beautiful with a large perforated grille featuring the prominent brand's logo in the center with chrome embellishment. On either side of the grille, we can notice the trendy headlight cluster, which will mostly be fitted with LED lights, and turn indicators. The sporty bumper might get the body colour and houses a wide air intake as well. Besides these, we can also see the stylish daytime running lights fitted just at the top of both the air ducts. Another attractive element in its front fascia is the sloping bonnet that looks simply great with some visible character lines over it. On the sides, it will probably feature black cladding on the wheel arches, which slightly bulge. It is speculated to come with both 18 and 19 inch wheels, which will be covered with high performance tubeless radial tyres. Apart from the B-pillars, even the wing mirrors might be painted in black with side turn blinkers integrated into them. Moving on to its rear, it looks like its tail section has been slightly increased, which adds to grace and elegance. We can notice the wide dimension of its windscreen that will mostly include a defogger. The boot lid with its brand name is quite appealing, whereas the tail light cluster gets a good design as well. Apart from this, the sharp design of its bumper will impress you, while the skid plate beneath it will further give it a rugged appearance.As of now, we do don\u2019t have any concrete information about its boot space. However, keep looking at this section for updates. InteriorAs Volvo has now put its focus on the crossover segment, we can certainly expect it to offer this particular model with the best of features that will appeal to the masses. This one will be a five seater with a plush and roomy cabin that might come with different attractive colour options to choose from. A few of its pictures reveal its insides, wherein, we can notice a well designed dashboard integrated with several advanced components. Whereas, the neat metal plating on some of the equipments further adds to its elegance. A power steering wheel is expected with tilt adjustment facility, and it might also come mounted with several switches for easy operation of other functions. And an advanced air conditioning unit will be on the offer, to create a pleasant ambiance while you are on the journey. As for the seats, we can anticipate getting front adjustable seats along with lumbar support probably for the driver, whereas the rear ones might receive folding function that will be useful for increasing boot space. Aspects such as auto-dimming inside mirrors, power windows, trip computer, electrically powered glass sunroof, and many storage spaces will be on offer. Besides these, nothing much has been revealed about its interiors, but it is rumored to carry most of the elements that are available in the existing S60 sedan. PerformancePresently, reports are doing rounds that the Volvo S60 Cross Country will be on the offer with two diesel engine options. In the international market, it is also available with a petrol drive train. So, this leaves us with a thought that it may also have a petrol version, but no such information is out yet. DieselAccording to reports, this cross sedan is said to have a 2.4-litre, D4 diesel engine that is likely to generate a maximum power of 180bhp. This might come with five cylinders and be based on the all-wheel drive mechanism. On the other hand, it might also be powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged oil burner and make an appearance with front wheel drive configuration. Both these motors are expected to be paired with a six speed automatic transmission gear box, which might deliver superior performance. Ride and HandlingAs of now, we have no information regarding the kind of suspension system it may be offered with. But, we are hoping it might have the same system as the current S60 model, which comes with front independent McPherson strut and the rear multi link system. In terms of braking, it will most likely have a robust set of disc brakes fitted to both its front and rear wheels. Besides these, a speed sensitive electric steering column might be on offer. This one gives you good control over the vehicle besides simplifying its maneuverability on any road condition.SafetySafety has always been a top priority in all the models offered by this brand. So, we are sure this upcoming vehicle too has many vital safety elements. This may be loaded with aspects like dynamic stability and traction control, tyre pressure monitoring system, safety belts with pretensioners and load limiters, and Voice On Call functions. Apart from these, it will also have airbags, whiplash protection system, immobilizer, automatic door locking and many such features which add to the passenger security. VariantsAccording to the information gathered so far, this model will be available in two variants with two different engine options. Except for the technical specifications, the features list might remain the same in both variants. VerdictVolvo is one such renowned brand, which has always impressed the masses through its vehicles in all aspects, be it the engine performance, advanced safety or the enhanced comfort. Even this yet-to-be-launched model seems quite promising with some interesting elements on the list. We are only hoping that the S60 Cross Country does well as good as the other successful vehicles from this brand, once it enters our market.

This third generation model was introduced in 2013 and is yet to recieve a major cosmetic update.

In the center, the kidney bean shaped radiator grille looks perfect in side and comes with vertical slats. They are garnished in chrome for a classy appeal.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe front bumper looks smaller in size, but has enough muscle to render a dynamic appeal to the frontage.

However, on the design front, it needs some more upgrades to match its rivals.\u000a\u000aPerformance :\u000a\u000aDiesel :\u000a\u000aThis stunning machine gets a 3.0-litre diesel engine that is powerful, efficient and has displacement capacity of 2993cc. This TwinPower turbo motor comes with state-of-the-art fuel injection technologies that aids in improved fuel economy. On the highways, it gives you approximately 15.97 Kmpl, which is quite good compared to what its rivals offer.

Around six airbags are on the offer to prevent possible injury caused due to an impact, while all the occupants get three point seat belts with front pyrotechnic belt tensioners and force limiters. Electronic immobilizer safeguards the vehicle from theft, whereas the advanced ABS, cornering brake control as well as dynamic stability control are helpful in boosting the braking performance besides keeping the machine in good control. Other attributes such as the BMW Condition Based Service, ISOFIX child seat mounting and run flat indicator also aid for a safer journey.\u000a\u000a\u000aVariants\u000a\u000a\u000aHere, the Expedition variant is offered with an array of interesting features like the BMW Driving Experience Control, multifunction sport leather steering wheel, Hi-Fi loudspeaker system, 8-speed steptronic automatic transmission and many more.\u000aThe xDrive 30d Design Pure Experience trim, which is a five seater, gets a few extra elements such as an 8-speed steptronic sport automatic transmission, BMW Apps, Harman Kardon Surround system, and adaptive LED headlights with auto high beam assistance to name a few.\u000aIn the 7-seater range, you will get the foldable third row seats to make additional room for luggage, while it also has heating/ventilation console with cup holders as an added benefit.\u000aMeanwhile, the top spec M Sport model includes BMW head-up display, Adaptive M suspension system, 19-inch double spoke style M light alloy wheels as well as M Sport Package, which altogether makes it the most expensive variant in the entire lineup.\u000a\u000a\u000aVerdict:\u000a\u000aThe third generation BMW X5 has undergone changes over the year, but the handling still feels like what it was back in 1999. This SUV offers exceptional driving dynamics and sheer balance, which only a few SUVs of this size can offer. The 3.0-litre twin-power turbo diesel engine under the hood is punchy and powerful enough to surprise you. Adding to this, its smooth 8-speed automatic gearbox makes driving even exciting. This BMW has everything that a high-end luxury SUV should have. But on the design front, its interiors needs a bit of work. Also, it could use some tweaks to the exterior design like we've seen in 3-Series sedan and X3 SUV. Another big drawback is that the rear cabin is not comfortable for adults.

This small BMW beast has literally turned the tide for the manufacturer in India by emerging one of the best-selling luxury cars in the country.Pros:1. Its 2.0-litre twin-power turbo diesel engine is now the most powerful in its class.2. It is packed with state-of-the-art features and cutting-edge technologyCons:1. It's almost four years since entering into its sixth generation. Still awaiting a complete overhaul.2. Spare wheel is missing. Travelling farther distance could be risky.Standout features:1. BMW Driver experience control with four different modes. It's Sport + mode unleashes the real performer within.2. Rear wheel drive makes for the 50:50 load distribution and offers superior ride quality.Background and Evolution:BMW 3 Series has been present in India for a while now and is currently serving its sixth generation. Although it is present in the automobile world for more than forty years, 3-series entered India only after 2007 with its fifth generation followed by its sixth generation in the year 2012.Overview:The German auto giant BMW has launched the facelift version of its smallest luxury sedan here in India, ahead of the upcoming auto expo. It was initially scheduled for a launch in February during the auto show, but company pushed its launch days ahead. The 2016 3 series flaunts a slightly tweaked headlight cluster with full LED headlamps and new LED daytime running lights. The manufacturer has also made subtle changes to the interiors as well. A new variant coded 320d M Sport has been added to the series, while retaining all the existing variants. For now, this sedan series is available with just a 2.0-litre diesel engine option. Its power output has been increased to 190bhp from 184bhp of its outgoing model.Exteriors:The 2016 3 Series comes with subtle changes on its exteriors. On the front facade, this car gets a redesigned headlight cluster featuring LED headlamps and Daytime running lights. Below this, the bumper gets a new design featuring restructured LED fog lights that dazzles the facet. The overall design language however remains to be the same.This model series also get a new set of 17-inch alloy wheels. These rims are covered with 225/50 R17 sized radial tubeless tyres. However, its entry level prestige trim continues to be on offer with 16 inch alloy wheels. On the other hand, its GT Sport Line gets multi-spoke, 18 inch alloy wheels adorned with tubeless tyres of size 225/50 R18.The taillight cluster at the rear has been restructured and is now equipped with LED brake lights. Apart from these changes, no updates were made to the car.The GT Sport Line has kidney shaped grille with nine slats in high gloss black colour. This is emphasized by the thick chrome surround and the company's emblem is embossed at the tip of its bonnet.Moving to its sides, the high gloss B-pillars and window surrounds in Matte Black finish makes for a stunning appeal. The foldable external mirrors have heating and automatic anti dazzle functions. They are integrated with LED side turn blinkers.What's noticeable in its rear end are luminous tail light cluster equipped with turn indicators and there is also a wide windshield with defogger. The active spoiler on its boot lid not just gives a sporty look, but also helps in its driving dynamics.\u000aAlthough receiving some minor tweaks to its outsides, its overall dimensions remained unaltered. It comes with a length of 4624mm, width of 1811mm, and a height of 1429mm. It has a pretty long wheelbase of 2810mm and a generous ground clearance of 157mm.Interiors:This 2016 version's interior design remains largely identical to its predecessor. The company made few improvements with regards to the cosmetics and quality of materials. Besides careful usage of chrome and high gloss inserts, the company has added a new feature in the form of Ambient lighting system that exudes a sense of luxury and richness inside the cabin.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNow, the multi-functional steering wheel is accompanied with paddle shifters that add to the convenience quotient.Everything about the interior is so fascinating right from its two tone color scheme to well cushioned seats. Soon after entering inside, you'll notice the beautifully sculptured central console housed with all the necessary equipments. This latest version gets a refined infotainment system featuring a bigger 8.8-inch high resolution touch screen display. This contemporary in-car entertainment unit also features Global Positioning System (GPS) that aids in navigation. This system also features BMW ConnectedDrive that provides access to various pre-installed applications. It supports Bluetooth hands-free and USB for audio streaming.\u000aThe instrument panel has a sporty design and it is packed with numerous analog gauges. It features a fuel gauge, speedometer, rev counter, fuel consumption, warning lights and so on.\u000aBoth seats in the first row are electrically adjustable, and the driver's seat additionally gets memory function. We found that the seats are well cushioned and comfortable, but not comfortable enough for long distance travelling.The rear cabin is little low with regards to the head space, but it offers better leg and shoulder room. In addition to this, it has a center armrest mounted with two cup holders that adds to the convenience quotient.Overall, we felt that the company could have made more updates to its design rather than focusing just on cosmetics front.Performance:The engine used for 2016 3 Series is the same 2.0-litre 4-pot mill, which is currently performing for outgoing model. However, the 2016 3 Series gets it with minor updates with more power output. As a result, its output has gone up to 190bhp of power that results in 400Nm of torque. This has further improved its acceleration, as it can now break the 100 kmph mark in just 7.2 seconds. We are yet to test this refined version, only then we will be able to make our final judgment. Its 1995cc twin-turbo motor is a gem of an engine and its revs sound sweet and powerful. The presence of two turbo units has certainly added up to its impressive power output and the turbo lag is in negligible levels. Be it a city road or a highway, this motor feels relaxed, even at the speed of 160 kmph. The company claims it can achieve a top speed of 235 kmph. On the other hand, it is capable of returning 18.88 kmpl mileage. The transmission is the same 8-speed automatic unit that transmits engine output to the rear wheels. For now, there is no petrol engine option, but BMW is mulling to introduce it in the next half of 2016.Ride and Handling:Driving a BMW 3 Series is absolute fun, especially on open roads. It features a state-of-the-art steering unit that can adapt the angle of the front wheels enabling it to respond directly to the steering command. The steering wheel is neither light nor hard. It actually feels perfect and responds to each command precisely. Driving this car actually feels safe, thanks to the high performance disc braking mechanism. All the four wheels have been assembled with disc brakes that deliver excellent stopping power. Additionally, anti-lock braking system and cornering brake control system does their job pretty well and helps the car to be stable, while taking sharp curves. Another feature we need to talk about is the advanced suspension. It has a double joint tension strut assembled on its front axle, and the rear one gets a five arm axle. Besides, its rear wheel drive mechanism makes for balance axle load distribution.Safety and Security:This 2016 version retains all its safety features without any updates. It is loaded with a number of crucial features that guarantees passenger security to a great extent. All the occupants are offered with three point seat belts, and additionally have pyrotechnic belt tensioners and force limiters at front. There are as many as six airbags inside the cabin that minimizes the risk of injury for the occupants.\u000aThe dynamic stability and cornering brake control helps in its stability and prevents it from skidding. It also includes an immobilizer that avoids unauthorized access into the vehicle, while there is also ISOFIX child seat mounting. Protection is further enhanced by its intelligent airbag system, dynamic traction control, central locking, side impact protection beams, run flat indicator, emergency spare wheel and warning triangle with first aid kit.\u000aVariants:At present, this BMW 3 Series comes in a total of four variants among which, M Sport is the new trim. Its base trim 'Prestige' misses out on some features like Hi-Fi loudspeaker system, ambient lights package and electric glass roof. Also, it gets standard Sensatec black upholstery instead of leather upholstery. Other remaining features are identical to those in high end variants. To begin with, this series has features like front sliding armrest with storage compartment, 2-zone automatic AC unit with rear vents, multi-functional steering wheel, electrically adjustable front seats and engine start/stop button.Verdict:BMW 3 Series offers a wonderful drive quality and its maintenance cost is considerably low. Now, the car outperforms its rivals by producing more power than any other vehicle in its class. Also, it is one of the safest sedans that you can get in the entry level sedan series. Despite few shortcomings, this is the car that you can bank on.

VIntroduction:Mercedes-Benz is one of the most acclaimed car makers in the world, and this auto giant has been successful in making its mark in Indian terrain as well. With the launch of the E-Class, the company goes one notch up in its hold of the luxury saloon market. We thought that this car had just about everything, from the exotic look to the most refined interiors and a broad list of features. However, there are things that every model lacks in, and we're here to dig through the vehicle to see what those are.Pros:1. Lavish interior environment that is sure to appeal to modern audiences.2. Advanced comfort and entertainment features that makes the ride all the more enjoyable.Cons:1. Its price is sure to deter many buyers.2. Ground clearance is weak.Stand-Out Features:1. A broad host of safety aids make the ride peaceful, secure and enjoyable, and we thought this was its strongest element.Overall:E-class is the saloon that has been waiting to set out on our streets. In its latest avatar, the vehicle boasts a whole new set of features, and a far more refreshed cabin that would amuse the masses. The exterior of the machine has been done up in a rich and prolific manner, and we thought there were influences of other models from the company in the design. The car comes with both petrol and engine alternatives, with a 2.1-litre diesel engine and a 2.0-litre petrol engine, both the motors are built to provide decent performance. Exteriors:The vehicle does make a daring statement, with its luxurious body format that is also specialised for a racy edge. We thought that balanced body dimensions, a low profile and a more agile posture helped to hone its look. Meanwhile, plush design themes enrich the overall appeal, so that when you stand before the machine, you feel a rather distinct allure that draws you towards it. The front is animated by the massive grille with the star emblem by the centre. The silver highlights by the grille make for a more energetic poise, along with the thin headlamps that bulge outwards into the side profile. The skin of the front flows down, sculpting the three part air dams that add some vigour to the image. The large bonnet extends over a large area, improving the masculine dimension of the machine. The gentle creases on the hood were excellent, and we thought that they underlined the machine's flawless build character. The bonnet gently rises up towards the windscreen, before melding into it. The wheel arches by the side have been given a more distinct impression, wrapping over perfectly crafted wheel rims that are sure to get people delighted. We noticed black highlights on the window frames, and this did invoke a more unique sense of vitality for the image. The overall structure has been perfected with a heavier rear portion, ensuring a sense of symmetry and harmony in the shape that gives the vehicle its glamour. Gentle body lines surf the door-sides, merging at the rear.The exhaust pipes by the corner of the bottom awakens a sportier side of the vehicle that we thought blends perfectly with the image. The curtly designed tail-lamps are positioned outside of the tail-gate, which is embellished with a chrome strip for a more lavish reflection. Interiors:There is a heavy theme of lavishness that runs over the cabin, and we know for one that this is the ideal car for luxury seekers. The leather dressing, the wooden inlays, chrome highlights and many more plush themes interact to bring forth a visually powerful layout for the place. At the front, the dashboard has been split into two portions, with the upper region hosting the large TFT 14.7cm colour display at the centre, along with two AC vents by the corner. The lower half of the dash comes with three AC vents spread right below. We loved the way the centre console slides down gently, merging into the gear shifter region in an expensive finish. The steering wheel comes with the standard Mercedes design, and we thought that there was a bold effect with the large star emblem at the centre. The seating arrangement was just as good as anyone would expect it to be, with the most uncompromising support for the passengers' well being. Lumbar support, electrical adjustment, along with headrests and many other facilities together make the ride just as cosy as it can get. Legroom is great on both rows, and we're sure that people of all sizes would have an enjoyable experience in here. The rich leather dressing further enhances the grand treatment, keeping all aspects of the ride at their peak. Performance:Diesel:Available with diesel as well as petrol engine options, the machine comes with a 2.1-litre diesel engine that comprises of 4 in-line cylinders. The company has modelled the power-train with some advanced technologies, ensuring that the running efficiency is kept at its optimum. This includes a new generation, common rail fuel injection system, powerful combustion chambers and precisely controlled piezo injectors. We thought that the specs levelled onto a decent plane, with 201bhp of power along with 500Nm of torque. It displaces a healthy 2143cc, going far ahead of many segment rivals. The engine's power is funnelled through a 7-speed automatic transmission, and the driver couldn't feel more relaxed and will love the overall ride experience. Petrol:On the petrol front, there is a 2.0-litre petrol mill that displaces 1991cc. It comes with 4 in-line cylinders, along with variable valve control and a turbocharger for the best working standard. The direct fuel injection system ensures smooth fuel transfer. It falls behind considerably with the specifications, with a power of 180bhp and a torque of 300Nm. Like for its diesel counterpart, the engine has been geared with a 7-speed automatic gearbox. Ride and Handling:It's no surprise that this company has mastered the art of providing a comfortable, pleasant ride, and passengers would find a hard time finding things to complain about. We thought that the overall ride was steady and smooth, with mere whiskers of unease in rare cases. Nevertheless, you're sure to feel blanketed in cosiness rarely found in home-made cars of domestic brands. The car has been programmed with a DIRECT CONTROL suspension arrangement. A selective damping facility further enhances the ride quality, ensuring that the passengers are kept comfortable, while at the same time, ensuring strong stability. Shock absorbers have been coupled onto the chassis as well, helping to swallow road anomalies without deterring the ride flow. We were also amazed at the Machine\u2019s responsive steering, which relieves a lot of strain for the driver. The car boasts a direct steering system that brings a more direct steering ratio, giving sharper agility and cornering power for the vehicle. Safety:The list of safety facilities seems never ending. The company seems to have left no stone unturned in bringing the firmest shield of security for the occupants. The passengers are kept well guarded with a system of eight airbags, which includes dual front airbags, side airbags, pelvis airbags and window airbags as well. Apart from this, a whole basket of crucial safety aids ensure that the ride quality is kept preserved, and this includes the Anti lock braking system, Acceleration skid control, Brake assist, Active parking assist and Electronic stability program.  An adaptive high beam assist ensures strong visibility when driving, along with an intelligent lighting system.Variants:There are three variants for the model, the E200, the E250CDI and the E350CDI. The majority of the features are shared by all of the models, and the differences come with regard to the drive system and the engine. All of the variants come along with full LED headlamps, an electric sunroof, a digital speedometer, a trip computer in the multi-function display, an Eco start/stop function, a tyre pressure loss warning system, rain sensing intermittent wipers, a central locking system. However, the E200 and E250CDI trims come with some specific features, including a 14.7cm TFT colour display, a 6 CD charger, a USB function, Bluetooth connectivity and an Infotainment system. The E350CDI, on the other hand, has a Harmon Kardon Logic 7 surround sound system, a media interface, a 360 degree camera, and a navigation system. Verdict:This is definitely a one of a kind vehicle, but we know for one that it would go only with a particular niche of people. It brims with luxury, comfort and lavish delights of the most expensive sort, while at the same time, giving passengers a decent width of all other aspects as well. On the downside, however, there is the hefty price and it is not the most fuel efficient machine as well. At the end, we'd say that this is the car for luxury loving customers who would be willing to go the extra mile for the right drive experience. For people looking for a regular car with a smaller budget, some other car would be suitable for you.

VMahindra and Mahindra is a well famed automobile brand, which is known for producing utility vehicles in both passenger and commercial segment. It is among those to bring the most affordable off-roaders to the country's automobile market. In the year 2010, it introduced \u000aMahindra Thar\u000a to the off-road aficionados of our nation. Ever since, it has not received any update whether it is styling, comfort, safety or technical specifications. After a long time now, they have now introduced its refurbished version with notable changes to its exteriors and quality. However, it continue to be available with the same diesel engine options like its predecessor. One of them is the 2.5-litre DI (direct injection) based mill that churns out 63bhp. This mill of the base as well as the mid range trims and is mated with five speed manual gearbox. The top end is fitted with a powerful 2.5-litre CRDe diesel power-train that is capable of unleashing 105bhp. As for its drive type, its mid and high end line-up is available with 4x4 mechanism that allows the vehicle to perform better while off-roading. To enhance the off-road driving, the company is now offering 'Mlocker' as an optional feature, which is composed by Eaton. It is nothing but a mechanical locking system that is helpful to get rid of stickiest grounds, while driving. Coming to the updates, it gets restyled bumpers, along with fender extensions. There is a large tilted foot rest at the rear end for easy ingress into vehicle. The interior section gets majority of changes in the form of a dual tone dashboard, newly designed air vents with silver finish and a smart looking instrument cluster. The seats have got wider with improved cushioning that eventually provides better comfort to the occupants. The manufacturer has borrowed some aspects like its steering wheel, air conditioning controls, gear lever and hand brake from their Bolero SUV. However, most of these changes have been given to the top end variant only. Apart from this, all the others have been retained from its forerunner. In terms of safety, it has a superior MM body shell with modified inner shell that helps protect the occupants from impact. It also gets superior suspension, which is an aspect that helps to keep it stable on all grounds. This SUV has a segment of its own, where there are no notable names to give it a tough competition. However, Force Gurkha is the one that could eat up a certain percentile of its sales.This off-roader has all the exterior elements that makes it appear like a pure sports utility vehicle. The manufacturer has made a few worthy changes to its exteriors, while retaining its signature body structure. It gets redesigned bumpers with plastic shape. At the same time, it gets new fender extensions that compliments its new look. The classy round shaped headlight cluster has been retained with the radiator grille. Also there is no change made to the bonnet and it continues to have a flat surface with curvy edges. The windscreen is quite wide yet small, which is another signature exterior aspect. The company's lettering has been given on the lower central section of the windscreen frame. Coming to the sides, it has specifically form of fenders for adding bold appeal to the sides. These fenders get a pronounced layout, which is the only update you can notice on the side facet. They are mated with a sturdy set of steel rims, which the door panels are also retained with an expressive pattern on them. They are hinged like its predecessor, which keeps its classy appeal. The outside rear view mirrors have black caps and they are manually adjustable. The rear section too have received some minor update in the form of modified canopy. Like the front bumper, its rear one too has plastic and metal combination that enhances its elegance. The boxy taillight cluster is carried out from its predecessor that houses brake lamps with courtesy light and turn indicator.\u000a \u000a \u000aExterior Measurements:\u000a \u000a \u000a Like its predecessor, this newly launched off-roader has an overall length measuring 3920mm with a width 1726mm. Its has a generous height standing at 1930mm and a minimum ground clearance of 200mm. Its front track measures about 1445mm and the rear one at 1346mm. However, the variants with DI mill has a width of 1640mm, front track of 1314mm and a rear track of 1295mm. Its wheelbase measures about 2430mm, which is not really a worry, since it has a different seating configuration. Moreover, its approach angle of 46 degrees and departure angle of 30 degrees helps it to deal with terrains.Ed's take\u000a : The interiors of the Thar are bare and basic. It hasn\u2019t been designed to give you the best comfort, but for you to enjoy off-roading. It now comes with the option of AC too\u000a \u000a.\u000a This latest line-up gets a modified internal cabin that appears more appealing than the outgoing ones. Its cockpit houses a new dashboard that is done up in a 2-tone color scheme. It gets a restructured floor console that houses a handbrake with a gearbox console. The instrument cluster has a new three-tube outline with chrome accents on it. The central console too has undergone some tweaks and is now embedded with 'Thar' lettering that emphasizes its dynamic appeal. The air conditioning vents too have been restructured and they have been decorated with metallic surround. The steering wheel has been replaced with the one that is in the Bolero and is decorated with metallic inserts too. Apart from this, it has got some tweaks to the seats by widening them and by adding more cushion for enhanced comfort. Its gearshift knob gets a leatherette cover, which gives a premium appeal to the cabin. Meanwhile, all the remaining of the cabin have been retained from the outgoing version. It seems like a compact vehicle with limited seating facility, but the company claims that it can accommodate at least seven occupants. It has front facing seats in the cockpit and two side facing bench seats at the rear.\u000a \u000a \u000aInterior Comfort:\u000a \u000a \u000a This is an SUV, which is meant for pure off-roading and adventure. However, it falls behind in terms of comfort even after receiving some new components. Its cockpit section gets a new form of instrument cluster with three round shaped analogue meters like speedometer, rpm meter, fuel gauge and few more notifications lamps. This latest range gets the heating, ventilation and air conditioning borrowed from Bolero SUV. This is helpful for keeping the ambiance pleasant. Its controls are placed within the reach of driver that adds to the convenience. Now, the automaker has also added cup holders in the floor console. Driving this off-roader is simple, all thanks to the integral power assisted steering that can support a turning radius of just 5.25 meters. It comes as standard for the mid range and top end. It runs on rear wheel drive mechanism that optimizes the power delivery and makes driving even simpler. It is also offered with a premium soft top canopy that ensures that the interiors won't resemble like exteriors after mud-bashing. These are necessary for every off-road vehicle.\u000a \u000a \u000aInterior Measurements:\u000a \u000a \u000a This SUV has ample space to give all its occupants comfort inside. Only the front cabin occupants can have better leg and shoulder space, as rear cabin has side facing bench seats with lesser leg room. It is also embedded with a massive fuel tank of 60-litres, which is perhaps one of the biggest in this segment.Ed's take: \u000a The acceleration produced by the Thar is good, and it has a nice spread of torque. The DI is heavier as it has front leaf springs too.\u000a  This is the area where we cannot expect the Thar to be good, since it is a pure off-road SUV. The variant with the 'DI' based motor can reach a top speed of approximately 150 Kmph, while accelerating from 0 to 100 Kmph in about 16 seconds. The 2498cc CRDe engine can break the 100 Kmph barrier in about 13 to 14 seconds and reaches a top speed of 160 Kmph.Ed's take: The performance of the Thar is good and we love the way the engine pulls despite being in a higher gear. This makes it easy to pull the car when stuck while off-roading.\u000a  Like its predecessor, this newly launched modified range is available with two diesel engine options. Its base and the mid range are equipped with a 2.5-litre MDI 320TC L that has a displacement capacity of 2523cc. This is a four cylinder mill is integrated with a direct injection fuel supply system technology for optimum output. It can churn out 63bhp in combination with a pounding torque of 182.5Nm between just 1500 to 1800rpm. Its transmission duties are handled by a NGT 520, 5-speed manual transmission gearbox. Additionally, its mid range gets a manual shift transfer case with 2-speed gear levels. With this, the torque output is distributed to all its four wheels. The other mill is a 2.5-litre CRDe motor that is integrated with a common rail direct fuel injection technology. It also runs on a DOHC based valve configuration with four cylinders and 16-valves. It has the ability to generate an output of 105bhp at 3800rpm in combination with a hammering torque of 247Nm between 1800 to 2000rpm. This plant is mated to an advanced NGT 530R, 5-speed manual gearbox. It is accompanied by a BORGWARNER manual shift transfer case for distributing output to all four wheels.Ed's take: \u000a The fuel efficiency of the Mahindra Thar is good, as the off-roader returns about 9km to every litre on an average. The DI engine is a lot more frugal.\u000a  The company has made no changes to the technical specifications and retained the same oil burners. The MDI 3200TC L engine has direct fuel injection technology. This 2523cc powerhouse has the ability to give away a maximum mileage of 18.06 Kmpl (for 4x2) and 16.55 Kmpl (for 4x4). The other one is the CRDe that has common rail direct fuel injection system. This has the ability to give away a peak mileage of 18.06 Kmpl.Ed's take: \u000a The power produced by the engine is good, but it is the low-end torque that gives that kick. The DI is lesser powerful than the CRDe, but the power produced by it is sufficient.\u000a  Both the oil-burners comprise of 4-cylinders and 16-valves based on a double overhead camshaft valve configuration. The base and mid level are fitted with a 2523cc drive-train, which is capable of producing a maximum yield of 63bhp with a pounding torque of 182.5Nm. However, the 2498cc one is more capable, as it unleashes 105bhp that results in a hammering torque of 247Nm.Ed's take: \u000a The Thar now comes with a music system and AC in its top of the line version. Other than this, there are no other features on the Thar for your comfort.\u000a  This off-road king is available with an option to customize its interiors with various components. Its central console sports a 2-DIN touchscreen audio unit featuring GPS and an MP3 player. In addition to this, one can also opt for AUX-In, USB with various other utilities. Some of these include custom built central console with bottle holders, storage zones, leather cover for steering wheel and so on. At the same time, there is also a choice to customize the exteriors with various styling categories including grille, wheels, tyres and fenders.Ed's take: \u000a The handling characteristics of the Thar aren\u2019t great as it is design for off-road than quick driving on the road. But off the road it is fantastic.\u000a  The variants with this DI based drive-train have a dual circuit braking system with tandem master cylinder and vacuum assisted servo. While the top end trim gets hydraulic braking mechanism featuring tandem master cylinder with LCRV (load conscious regulating valve). One common thing is that all the variants have their front wheels with disc brakes and the rear ones are assembled with drum brakes, which performs well. Its entry level and mid range are blessed with leaf spring suspension for both front and rear axles. While the top end gets an independent front suspension and the rear axle is assembled with semi elliptical leaf spring.Ed's take: \u000a The Thar doesn\u2019t get airbags as safety. The chassis is also ladder frame with a lot of metal on it. Hence, it doesn\u2019t even have crumble zone on it.\u000a  It is built with a ladder frame chassis, which is even trusted by Indian Military. This makes it capable of withstanding any obstruction on any terrain. It also has wide tyres in its segment that offers excellent grip on slippery roads. It has a immobilizer, which is essential for protecting from theft. Other protective facets are seatbelts, 9 inch boosters with disc brakes, halogen headlamps and turn indicators.Entire series get a set of 16 inch steel wheel. As for the tyres, its top end gets slightly bigger ones of size P235/70 R16, while the remaining two trims get a sturdy set of P185 R16 sized tyres. Buyers can also opt for a stylish set of alloy rims with wide radials that changes the entire appearance of this off-roader.1. Its off-road capabilities are remarkable.\u000a \u000a 2. Performance of the CRDe mill is outstanding.\u000a \u000a 3. Low maintenance cost is its advantage.\u000a \u000a 4. Initial cost of ownership is very affordable.\u000a \u000a 5. After sales service network is good.1. Exterior updates are not as attractive as expected.\u000a \u000a 2. Safety and comfort can be improved.\u000a \u000a 3. Optional features can be given as standard.\u000a \u000a 4. Rear cabin seating can be comfortable.\u000a \u000a 5. Power and acceleration of DI motor can be improved.

VMahindra Quanto\u000a is a compact sports utility vehicle from the esteemed stable of Mahindra & Mahindra. Available only in a diesel version with four variants, it is promoted by the company to be a sturdy and sporty vehicle, which its exteriors also convey. Its body colored bumpers can be seen featuring a grille in fiery black color. The sides have door handles and external mirrors aligned perfectly with the body tone and side moldings have steel inserts. Side and rear doors have foot steps that are accompanied by puddle lamps. While the base trims have steel wheels with body colored spare wheel cover, top end is blessed with alloy wheels with a full size spare alloy wheel cover. A pair of stylish roof rails add sportiness, which this manufacturer aims to portray as. Interiors are well designed in a large cabin and have cushiony set of seats with reclining ability, single dump and double dump facilities. About 7 occupants can be accommodated comfortably within this spacious seating arrangement. A specially designed interior roof lamp lights the entire cabin with various effects.

Safety of this vehicle is packed with elements such as, intellipark reverse assist for reversing in tight corners particularly, fog lamps for clearer vision, dual airbags protect from head and chest injuries, ABS with EBD for anti-slip on roads, an engine immobilizer to safeguard vehicle from thefts and many other such features. Being a utility vehicle, its capacity of storage is what is a major factor. A boot space of 300 litres can be extended up to 690 litres by folding the third row seats. This amount of boot space is very advantageous in order to plan for long journeys. Apart from this massive space, its compartment also needs to facilitate a lot of stuff. This need is addressed by the car maker by incorporating bottle holders and magazine pockets in all doors, a mobile charging socket to the middle row, 2 front and 2 rear cup holders, foldable snack tray and storage under driver seat. In terms of internal ambiance that it offers, there is a 2-DIN audio system, which can support multiple media players, three charging points, tilt adjusting facility for steering, rear windscreen has a demister integrated and a wiper. It has a mCR100 engine that has twin turbo charger, which were first introduced into the Indian engines through this SUV. A combination of 100bhp power and 240Nm torque output will be considerable figures for an off-roading vehicle. Mated to a five speed manual transmission gear box, this has the ability to accelerate up to a maximum speed of 160 Kmph. Its fuel economy too stands at a reasonable figure which is ARAI certified. A micro-hybrid technology equipped in this series will help in switching-off the idle engine and hence minimize the fuel consumption. This will further increase the mileage, which is very impressive. A full size spare wheel is offered to all the variants which is fitted in the rear end of the vehicle. There is a 2 year or 50,000 Kilometer standard warranty offered by the company.This SUV is offered in six vibrant shades and the external body of it is designed in such a way that it will look good irrespective of its color.

Whereas on bigger roads, this mark can go up to 17.21 Kmpl.Editor's take :\u000a The power produced by the Quanto is good as this three-pot engine produces close to 100bhp of power.\u000a Its three cylinder and twelve valves based mill is arranged based on a double overhead camshaft valve system. A maximum power of 100bhp at 3750rpm and a torque output of 240Nm at 1600 to 2800rpm range can be expected from this mill.Editor's take : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe Quanto gets most of the features of the Xylo like in-dash music system, steering mounted audio controls etc.\u000a A lot of advanced features can be found in this offering. With regards to audio unit, the base and mid-variants are not incorporated with it. But the customer can add this to the vehicle on an additional cost as per preference.

User can further customize their vehicle with leather upholstery, body decals and many other such appeal enhancing or comfort improvisers can be added from authorized dealers.Editor's take : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe ride and handling of the Quanto is one area that doesn\u2019t impress us. The problem is that, neither the ride is excellent nor is the handling that great. \u000a \u000a \u000a \u000a Power steering feature and a minimum turning radius of 5.4 meters makes handling of this vehicle quite effortless and convenient.

VMahindra Supro\u000a van is the latest product in the utility vehicle segment, wherein Maruti Omni is still continuing its dominance. By its appearance, this vehicle looks much more like a people mover or like a maxi cab. However, the manufacturer ensured that it isn't just about an affordable mobility solution, but also about style and comfort. Starting off with the exteriors, we can see Mahindra's signature radiator grille up-front with chrome garnishing. Also, it has the company's logo embedded beautifully onto it. On its side profile, we can see body decals that somewhat add style to this van. But one cant deny the fact that the vehicle looks like the one made from scratch. Its interior design looks far better than its outer structure and can provide accommodation for eight adults. Its cabin has a dual color scheme giving a soothing effect to the eyes. This latest model from M&M has been launched in a total of three trims, all of which are powered by a 909cc diesel engine. This oil-burner is currently powering some small commercial vehicles of this company. Being a 2-cylindered mill, it produces a power output of 45bhp, which is good enough to move this 8-seater. By the way, its mid range VX trim is available with 5 and 8 seater option, while the top end ZX trim is purely a five seater. There are not many features associated with this van, since it is in the entry level segment meant to cut down the mobility cost. However, there are few essentials like a heating, ventilation and air conditioning unit that reduces the amount of stress by a greater extent. Also, there are facilities like mobile charger (12V), a digital clock, magazine pockets and a multi utility box. For the convenience of driver, this vehicle also gets an electric power assisted steering that simplifies the handling.\u000a \u000a Moving on to the safety section, it has a special front nose design ensuring maximized safety of occupants. This vehicle also gets the Mahindra's tough and rugged body structure with impact protection beams at crucial areas. Its dual LSPV braking mechanism is another factor that helps to improve control over the van, especially in case of sudden braking. Available with a warranty of 60,000 kilometers for 2-years, this vehicle comes as an ideal option for families.This is where company has applied reduced efforts in making this van. As we can see, its exterior structure represents outdated design. But the factors like body decals and chrome accents compensates for lack of proper design. On the front facade, we can see the signature radiator grille with vertical slats. Accompanied with this is a horizontal chrome strip, which is embedded with the company's logo. On its surround, there are headlight cluster housing halogen lamps, courtesy lights and turn blinkers. Its large front bumper is the one that adds bold appeal to this profile. It has a perforated air intake section along with provisions for fog lamp housings. Its front profile is the only thing, which is stylish about this van. The design of its sides is something that we can call it as a fashion disaster. It only has a basic design of an automobile. Its window frames and pillars looks cluttered, which isn't adding any style. The only style factor of this facet is the body decals. Its fenders are accompanied by standard steel rims, but they are accompanied with full wheel covers. The second row gets sliding doors that makes it convenient for gaining access to the insides. Its rear facet looks somewhat attractive considering its sides, all thanks to its stylish taillight cluster. The tailgate also has a decent structure and is decorated with models lettering along with brand's insignia. To enhance more safety to this facet, its windscreen is accompanied with a third brake light.\u000a \u000a \u000aExterior Measurements:\u000a \u000a \u000a If we go through the external dimensions of this van, we will certainly feel surprised and gets the doubt, whether if it is really an eight seater. This van measures just about 3798mm in its overall length and 1540mm in total width. Its wheelbase figures should leave you in a shock, since it is just 1950mm. The only good thing about its exteriors is its height of 1922mm, which is nearly equal to its overall wheelbase.The no-nonsense part about this four wheeler is its internal cabin. Once we go through the design, we will get an idea about the amount of importance it received from the maker. They have ensured basic essentials inside like storage units, charging point and other utilities to fulfill the requirements of passengers. One should talk about the seating arrangement, which is its plus point. Its cabin looks quite spacious from inside and it can accommodate a maximum of eight passengers. Its cockpit has seating for two while the rear cabin houses six adults. The rear cabin has two bench seats facing each other, creating more leg space for the occupants. This facility is available only for base and mid range trims. While the top end trim has seating option only for five adults. This vehicle gets sliding doors, which allows passengers to gain access to the cabin effortlessly. The interior is in a dual tone color scheme, which is another interesting factor of this vehicle. Going into further details, it has a distinctive instrument cluster featuring several gauges and meters to keep the driver informed. Its dashboard houses a glove box along with equipment like an AC unit. The steering wheel looks pretty simple with just two spokes and its grace is further amplified by the brand's insignia. Its floors are in brown color scheme, giving a plush appeal to the insides.\u000a \u000a \u000aInterior Comfort:\u000a \u000a \u000a Like mentioned above, this van from M&M is currently available in three variants. Among those, LX is the base version that has limited number of features. It lacks basic essentials like an AC unit, power steering and utility boxes that only adds to the traveling woes. However, it houses few facilities like a digital clock, cabin lamps at front and rear, a 12V mobile charging point and grab handles. Some of the other features in the list includes magazine map pockets and sun visors for both front passengers. The next-in-line VX 5-seater trim also has same set of features, but additionally, it gets a multi utility box as standard. Moving on to the top end trim, it is equipped with a heating, ventilation and an air conditioning unit that helps to reduce maximum discomfort that is caused while traveling. But disappointingly, the AC vents are present only in the front cabin. Apart from this, it additionally comes with a color coded interior along with bottle holders in central console. The mid range VX and top-of-the line ZX trims have electric power assisted steering system, which is helpful to reduce stress and efforts required to handle this van.\u000a \u000a \u000aInterior Measurements:\u000a \u000a \u000a The official brochure from the maker has no details with regards to the interior measurements, but we can see that it has good space. Like mentioned above, it can offer accommodation to a maximum of eight passengers along with space for luggage storage as well. It is also accompanied with a fuel tank that has a storage capacity of 33 litres.It would be biased to expect this van to be good at acceleration and pickup. Its power figures, weight and capacity does explain that this is a vehicle intended solely for transportation purpose. As a matter of fact, this van doesn't even reach a top speed of 100 Kmph, since its ability is limited to just about 95 Kmph. Hence, the pickup figures wont make much of a difference in this case.Powering this latest model is the 0.9-litre diesel engine, which is also performing duties in other CV models of the company. It is being tuned to draw more power from the thrusters, eventually compensating for its weight. It is a two cylindered mill integrated with a direct fuel injection technology for maximized output. This oil-burner with full thrust can generate a maximum power of 45bhp at 3750rpm and releases a torque of 98Nm between 1600 to 3000rpm. Its transmission duties are handled by a conventional 5-speed manual gearbox.Looking at the size of its engine, one would expect better mileage from this Van. However, its power to weight ratio and outdated direct fuel injection technology are the factors that are tarnishing its fuel efficiency figures. As for the company's claim, this vehicle comes with an efficiency to deliver a maximum mileage of 23.5 kmpl.The 909cc diesel mill is made to pull heavy weights. We can see the same oil-burner under the hood of Maxximo commercial truck and other CV's designed by the company. However, this 2-cylinder based mill has been tuned to churn out better power. As we can see the details, it produces 45bhp that results in a torque output of 98Nm.This vehicle scores nil with regards to the entertainment factor, since there is no CD player, nor at least FM/AM radio tuner. Customers have to depend on the vast accessory market, where they can find a number of such gadgets at a reasonable price. They can equip it with a 2-DIN music player along with speakers. Also they can opt for a touchscreen infotainment system that adds more excitement to the passengers inside. Besides equipment, one can also opt for styling factors like leather seats, floor carpets, alloy wheels, and other features that can give a new look to this van.This is one section, where it scores big as compared to others. This van, unlike other contenders, has got vacuum assisted hydraulic braking system with auto adjuster that provides maximum control over the van. Adding to this, its front wheels are mated with discs and the rear ones are assembled with drums for superior braking mechanism. As for suspension, its front axle is loaded with McPherson struts that further have coil springs. While the rear axle is being fitted with leaf spring type of suspension for maximized comfort while traveling. Its steering is another factor that reduces the efforts of handling this van.This four wheeler is built with the company's robust design, which is tough and rugged. This eventually gives it the capability to tackle the collision impact and to provide safety to the occupants inside. Its unique front nose design is another factor that enhances the safety levels. This vehicle is associated with a few other safety features like child safety locks, seatbelts, halogen lamps, rear reflectors and a high mount third brake light.This entry level van is being fitted with a set of standard 13 inch steel rims mated with full wheel covers. These wheels are further wrapped with 155/80 R13 sized radial tubeless tyres for better grip on roads.1. Presence of wide service network is its biggest advantage.\u000a \u000a 2. Fuel smart technology helps to reduce fuel consumption.\u000a \u000a 3. Its price range is quite reasonable.\u000a \u000a 4. Cabin space and seating option adds to its advantage.\u000a \u000a 5. Attractive warranty is its plus point.1. Absence of music system is a drawback.\u000a \u000a 2. There is a need to improve its exterior structure.\u000a \u000a 3. Comfort features are too little.\u000a \u000a 4. Its wheelbase is shorter than a hatchback.\u000a \u000a 5. Its safety section lacks basic features.

VIntroduction:Jeep has got a firm footing in markets around the world. The company has had a less-than-average position here in India, and its clear that the brand's gearing up to set this right. At the Auto Expo 2016, the brand showcased its upcoming launch for the market, the muscular new Grand Cherokee. As we took a look at the machine, we felt overwhelmed by the bold, menacing design and the smooth build. Information about the machine has been widely circulated, but there are bits and pieces to it that we had to put together from speculation and guesswork. Pros:1. Intimidating exterior design, something very few can turn down. 2. Customers would love the wide range of comfort and entertainment features within it.  Cons:1. The lack of some features across all variants could deter appeal for some. 2. Its heavy size takes a toll on the balance and handling at high speeds. Stand-out Features:1. A large field of aid programs such as ABS, ESC Hill hold assist and many others together make for a secure, well shielded drive. 2. It comes with a truly massive boot area, and this is be a definite thumbs-up for many customers,Overall:The vehicle is said to come with both petrol and diesel variants, with a 6.4-litre V8 engine for the petrol trim, and a 3.0-litre V6 engine on the diesel side. We expect some brazen performance figures that we're sure will surpass most other SUVs in the domestic market. Its inner comfort looks promising as well, with many features such as a Touchscreen system, a Harman Kardon 19-speaker system, a 7-inch LCD instrument cluster, leather dressed seats, power adjustment for the seats, and many others. All in all, even prior to its launch, this vehicle has got us curious and waiting for more, and we'd agree that many other auto-enthusiasts feel the same. Exteriors:This here, ladies and gents, is a monster. One glance at its tall, muscular design is enough to leave you with a breathless impression. We'll be honest here, never before have we laid eyes on a vehicle with such a pronounced, masculine characteristic, which is, at the same time, imbibed with a delicate, feminine touch. The overall composition of the body reflects a balanced layout, and this certainly does hike up its appeal. Its profile has a streamlined element that most people would find attractive, for it does add a sporty touch to the overall look. At the front, it wears a massive grille that comes with some noticeable silver elements for a more rejuvenated look. The front portion has been imbued with a more charismatic and powerful expression with the wide front skirt that drapes down all the way to the lower bumper. A large air intake section at the bottom of the skirt harmonises the entire image, and we thought it fit perfectly into the look. On either side of the grille, there are attractive headlamps that come with all necessary lighting units. Moving upwards, the hood spreads over a large area, and when you stand before the vehicle, you can feel an exalting, majestic demeanour with this. The refined curvatures that flow inwards into the hood added a rich touch to the design, and we'll tell you here itself that it's small aspects such as these that bring out the younger car lover in you. The windscreen has been swept back, and we could feel a strong aerodynamic agility here, allowing the right airflow when driving. On the side, the region surrounding the wheels comes with a more heavily toned effect, and we loved the distinctive impression this creates. The heavy lines that streak the door-sides are gorgeous, and the well sculpted body cladding adds to the vibrant effect. The roofline of the vehicle slides upwards, engaging a more beefed up rear area. The tail-lamps on either side of the boot trail into the side portion, and we thought this struck a rather good look. The fine lines that run through the boot-side add to the refined look, while at the base, the sporty exhaust pipes pack a more thrilling look that we know few people would turn down.Interiors:We've glossed through some photos on the web and gathered all we could about the machine. The cabin is more spacious than most people would desire. At the front, you're given more than enough room to stretch your legs out, while headroom and shoulder room are also fine. The second row could have been improved slightly according to some sources, although it's quite possibly more comfort-oriented than most other SUVs of its class. The layout and styling of the cabin is pretty marvellous, but you might want to keep your expectations in check, because it's not the type that you'd find within Audi/BMW/Mercedes-Benz. We definitely adored it, with the fine treatment and the expensive highlights. There is an edge of sophistication that you can trace in the design, and we personally thought it was very well done. We aren't too sure about the colour scheme, but we get the idea that there could be a two two colour scheme. At the front, the upper section of the dashboard is to come in a lighter colour, while the lower portion that flows down towards the leg area would be darker. AC vents are present on either side of the dash, and on either side of the console by the centre. A thick wooden garnish runs the length of the dashboard, stretching into the doorsides as well. This definitely does rake up the glamour within, and we thought that it was unlike other models that we see today. At the focus of the console is a 8.4-inch Touchscreen display with the buttons aligned below it. The placement and arrangement of the system was great, bringing a modern pulse to the interior that most people would find enthralling.The area surrounding the console is wrapped in the same silver embellishment, making for a more opulent and energetic look. At the bottom of the console, the gear-shift lever has been placed right next to a bottle storage region. By the corner, the steering wheel is to come with fine leather dressing, and we're sure few people would turn down this thrill. Paddle shifters have been incorporated by the wheel, allowing for easier shifting. Coming to the seating arrangement, you're sure to love the black leather upholstery that lavishes the seats, and it comes along with Suede inserts for a more affluent touch. When you take a seat here, you're sure to feel more relieve than in most other cars, with the strong ergonomic design, along with many reliable comfort facilities. This includes seat heating, 4-way adjustable lumbar support, split folding for the rear seats, and ventilation for the front seats. With all of these and more, we can safely say that riding in this vehicle, upon its release, is going to be quite a breeze.Performance:Diesel:Meagre information about the specs are available on the net. On the diesel side, the machine comes along with a 3.0-litre V6 EcoDiesel engine. Reliable sources place its power somewhere around     700bhp, and this makes the vehicle quite the monster. It is known to come along with an 8-speed Paddle-Shift automatic transmission, and we're sure that shifting couldn't get easier than with something like this. The vehicle's drive is said to be strong and confident, with an easy cruising and sprinting capacity, together with a sound acceleration as well. We're sure that most Indians would love to get their hands on a machine such as this, with good performance along with a reliable handling to come along with it. Petrol:On the petrol front, the vehicle comes along with a 6.4-litre V8 engine, and this gives you some pretty raw performance.  It pumps out a healthy 474bhp, and is meshed with the same 8-speed automatic gearbox. We hear that the machine can zoom from 0 to 100kmph in just 4.8 seconds, and we've got to tell you folks, that is a pretty intense figure for a vehicle of this size and structure.  Ride and Handling:Like we do in our other reviews, we weren't able to ride the vehicle personally. But we did unveil a lot about its inner infrastructure, and we can't say we weren't impressed. A steel suspension is present for two of the lower end variants, while an active damping suspension is present for the top end trim. A conventional front axle differential, along with a conventional rear axle differential has been equipped onto both arms of the chassis, helping to further bolster stability and handling. An electro-hydraulic power steering system augments the handling, and we hear that the steering response is just as clean as a driver could want it to be. Its rugged composition is sure to relieve occupants of the regular road hassles that come from potholes and other road anomalies. Passengers on the inside could feel occasional hitters with the more punishing road formats found in our country, but the overall ride quality is said to be okay. As for the braking part, 4-wheel disc brakes help to ease out the halting and cornering process, ensuring that you meet little strain during tighter situations. A low level of body roll is naturally expected, given the vehicle's bulky size, but we're confident that conventional Indian audiences can take it without breaking a sweat. Safety:We're happy to tell you that the list of safety facilities is massive in this vehicle, and most people would have no reservations about the security set-up when seated in here. Strong drive programs help strengthen the drive, including the ABS, rain brake support, ready alert braking, hill start assist, hill descent control and electronic stability control. The more conventional list includes a keyless entry system, remote keyless entry security alarm, airbags by the front as well as the side, park view rear back-up camera, front passenger seatbelt assist and many more. Altogether, we've got to tell you, there's very little that the vehicle lacks in terms of safety, and this is sure to come as one of the model's strongest aspects for its buyers. Variants:The model series is expected to come with three trim levels, Limited, Summit and SRT. Of these, Limited is the entry level variant, and it comes with a passable list of features, including a 5.0-inch Touchscreen display, 6 speakers, dual USB ports for charging, an integrated voice command that comes along with Bluetooth, a remote SD card slot, 3-point centre rear seatbelts, 4-wheel traction control and many more. Meanwhile, the mid variant, Summit, comes with a rear seat dual screen Blue ray/DVD player, GPS Navigation, 9 amplified speakers with a subwoofer, a ParkSense park assist system, leather trimmed perforated seats that come along with edge welting, and ventilation system for the front seats. The high end variant, SRT has it all, people. You get an SRT high performance audio system, 5-spoke wheels, an electronic rear limited-slip differential system, a Selec-track system and many more that's sure to woo anyone to step into the ride.Verdict:We'll be honest with you, it's hard to judge a vehicle with such amazing depth. The Grand Cherokee is displaying promise like no other vehicle has, and its response in other markets is pretty good. We're sure that a major class of Indian car lovers would enjoy this vehicle's enthralling exteriors, luxurious interiors and the never ending list of comfort. Its handling and performance would charm the sportier section of the crowd, and youngsters would definitely love the overall style and glamour. In the end of the day, we're going to have to wait for the machine to be launched here before we can ascertain whether it's destined to fly or to flop.

VIntroduction:The Fortuner was originally launched at a price point of around 18 lakhs. Over the years, Toyota has increased its prices and as of today, the Fortuner is a 25 lakh rupee SUV. With every price hike, the feature list hasn\u2019t grown much. The numbers are fast dwindling from a phase where it used to outsell all its competition, combined. The refreshed Fortuner is stated for launch only in the later part of 2016. Does it still have the steam to ward off the better equipped and competitively priced Ford Endeavour? We find out. Pros:1. Tough and rugged build with a go anywhere attitude. 2. Imposing design, even after so many years. High on road presence. 3. Decent fuel efficiency compared to the competition. Cons:1. The ladder on frame design compromises on handling. The Santa-Fe offer better sorted handing with its monocoque body. 2. The interiors are dated and the feature list is short. Stand-Out Features:1. The cabin area is expansive, and family-goers will surely love taking a ride with this.2. It has pretty respectable performance when placed beside others of its class.Overview:The Fortuner is offered with two engine options. The original 3.0L and the 2.5L derived from the Innova. The 3.0L version is offered in 4 trims. A 4x2 and a 4x4,  in combination with either an automatic or manual box. The interiors have a 3 row layout, a favourite with buyers in this segment. We've got to admit, the vehicle does lack in some aspects, and this includes the entertainment and comfort elements among others. The infotainment system is dated and no match to what the competition current offers. With people demanding a lot from a car in the segment and its price point, Toyota has got to pick up its game. Exteriors:Standing tall and wide, the vehicle makes quite a bold impression at first sight. The design reeks an aura of menace. The front end is aggressive, with the massive hood with the scoop, the striking chrome grille and imposing bumper. The same aggressive design continues all the way to the back. This gives it oodles of road presence and is sure to make people move out of your way. Starting with the face, the dual tone radiator grille makes for a majestic poise at the front. Flanking this on either side, there are smoked headlamps with chrome highlights and we loved the subtle plushness here. The air dam along with the fog lamp housing run a black theme with the fog lamps a neat chrome bezel. The hood scoop posted at the centre of the bonnet adds some sporty value to the visuals, while the gentle lines on the bonnet balance it out. Along the side, the chrome door handles grabbed our attention. The black window frames and roof rails diversify the look, while the massive wheel fenders add muscle to the side. At the rear, the tail-lamps come with a concise design, while the chrome strip wraps up the dynamic effect that the machine constantly tries to make. Interiors:When you step inside the vehicle you will be greeted with a spacious cabin. The cabin is immense in size, and it can comfortably house seven adults. Tall, plump and burly members of our team found little to fret over during the course of the drive. The dash is a single tone black unit with touches of brushed silver and wood insert. Air conditioning vents simple trapezoidal units that close individually. The design of the centre console is down to earth and nothing out of the world, which is fine in our opinion. The infotainment system in a touch screen unit and is flanked by knobs and buttons. By the right of the dashboard, the 4-spoke steering wheel was great to hold, and we thought there was no compromise on grip. The wheel is dressed in leather, and accentuated by silver accents. The infotainment, MID and voice control system are present on either side of the steering wheel. Positioned right in front, the instrument cluster houses the speedometer, the tachometer and a third dial displaying fuel indicator. The speedometer comes with chrome rings, and the illumination on the dials makes it easy to read at all times. When you take a seat in here, it's more than clear to you that the Japanese company has applied a sound knowledge of ergonomics in terms of seating arrangement.The seats are wide and comfortable, and we could find very little to complain about. The plush leather upholstery adds a more enriched quality to the drive, while the integrated headrests and armrests further rake up comfort. Members of our team seated in the second row were more than happy with the legroom there, but the third row could have done better. While the back support is excellent, the seats lack under thigh support. Performance:Packed within the car is a D-4D diesel engine that displaces a respectable 2982cc. The machine impresses with some pretty neat specs, including a torque of 343 Nm at 1400rpm to 3400 rpm, and a power of 142 bhp at 3400 rpm. We were happy with the overall power-play of this engine, with a low turbo lag and a linear power delivery that will ensure a good ride experience for most. Overtaking is easy, and can even be done without down-shifting. However, we've got to tell you that the loud engine noise might dampen your spirits, while at higher, sailing speeds, you should be able to let it pass. Ride and Handling:Most of Toyota's models come with pretty robust dynamics, capable of taking on the tough Indian roads. This one was no different, but there definitely could have been improvement. The chassis is well suited for the needs of our roads. Uneven terrains occasionally bring out the bumpy side in the ride, and we would credit the body-on-chassis construction for this. The vehicle's body roll is quite contained, and we were surprised at the stability it can sustain at speeds higher than 130kmph. Its grip is also a pleasant factor, and we couldn't help but get the feel that it was cemented onto the floor all the way while driving. Its stopping power could be improved but is typical of SUVs of this size. Safety:The vehicle keeps its front occupants well shielded, with airbags as well as seat belts that come along with pretensioners and belt force limiters. Meanwhile, some advanced safety programs help to address the average passenger's concerns, including the anti lock braking system, the electronic brakeforce distribution system and the vehicle stability control. Aside from safety for just the occupants, an immobiliser brings safety for the machine as well, preventing theft and other insecurities.  Variants:The vehicle comes in four variants, 4X4 AT,  4X4 MT, 4X2 AT, 4X2 AT. The cosmetics, comforts and convenience features are standard across all the variants, and the sole difference is with respect to the drive format and the transmission. Verdict:If you would have asked us a year back, the Fortuner was one of the best options in the premium SUV segment. At this point, with the Ford Endeavour as its competitor, the Fortuner seems over priced and ill equipped. While it retains the advantages in terms of a rugged - go anywhere machine, we feel you should wait till the new one arrives.

When you take a look at the side of the vehicle, you're sure to\u000a feel the dynamism of its well balanced design.\u000a More bulk is added to the rear, with the roofline tapering down gently towards the boot. We thought that the \u000asporty charisma of the machine was marvellous.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe tail-lamps broaden outside of the boot, giving the rear region a more invigorated look. The boot lid has a refined chrome strip and we thought it was the perfect finish for the vehicle's look.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInteriors:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe cabin made a mark in our minds with its well spread, rich taste, along with the presence of numerous comfort aids. Much of the inside remains the same, but the new version exudes a more spacious feeling as a result of a longer wheelbase. We thought that the colour scheme was just right, \u000awrapping the space in a more holistic aura that is sure to appease anyone.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe upper side of the dashboard is furnished with a wood design décor that brings a more enriched quality to the space. At the centre, the 6.5-inch LCD TFT display invites a more sophisticated air into the cabin, with the buttons propped on either side of the screen for ease of usage. The Infotainment system is a new feature of this edition, and it is sure to delight pretty much anyone who steps into this place.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIncorporated below this is a dual zone AC system, which comes along with 2 individual knobs for adjusting the temperature control. The steering wheel is wrapped in leather, with a\u000a sporty design that we did admire.\u000a Steering controls have been integrated by the side of the wheel, with paddle shift behind the wheel.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInlays of wood\u000a embrace the door-sides\u000a as well,\u000a boosting the plush layout\u000a of the vehicle. The interior door handles have been lavished in chrome, while chrome door sills at the front and rear come along with the 'Superb' inscription for a more distinctive effect.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe well structured seats\u000a relieve you of most discomforts you'd face in other vehicle\u000as, and the presence of headrests is an added bonus.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLegroom was decent at the front as well as the rear, but if you're accustomed to larger and more lavishly laid vehicles, then you might have problems stretching out in here. Nevertheless, large and bulky members of our team had little issues during the ride.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAll of the seats are dressed in lavish Nappa leather and we thought that this particular factor stood out among any other in the ride. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPerformance:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDiesel:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor the diesel version, the company has used the same 2.0-litre TDI mill, but attuned to pump out more power and torque. This 1968cc oil burner has a turbocharger as well as a liquid cooling system. A high-pressure direct injection system ensures smooth transfer of fuel. It is now capable of pumping out 174.5bhp of power at between 3600-4000rpm and a torque of 350Nm between 1500rpm to 3500rpm. It comes with the same cylinder configuration like earlier with 4 cylinders and 16 valves incorporated together through the double overhead camshaft arrangement. Shifting is made much easier with a 6-speed automatic gearbox, and we're sure most drivers would enjoy the overall experience. As a result improvements, \u000athe train now puts out a mileage of 18.19kmpl, infusing a degree of fuel economy into the drive as well.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPetrol:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe petrol variants too get an improved 1.8-litre TSI engine that displaces 1798cc. It is now capable of producing a power of 177.46bhp between 5100-6200rpm along with a torque of 250Nm at 1250rpm to 5000rpm for the automatic version and 320Nm at 1450rpm to 3900rpm for the manual version. A turbocharger, a liquid cooling system and a direct fuel injection system together help to bolster the working of the engine. Like its diesel counterpart, it also gets a 4-cylinder configuration with same double overhead camshaft arrangement. The petrol engine can be opted to come with either a 6-speed manual gearbox or a 7-speed DSG automatic transmission. The petrol engine falls behind with regard to fuel economy, with a rather weak mileage value of 14.67kmpl for automatic and 14.12kmpl for the manual, which many people might find below par.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aRide and Handling:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe new edition retains the same braking and suspension systems. Altogether, you might find the overall ride quality to be more pleasant than today's mainstream releases. Regular road hassles, including pot-holes, \u000aare easily digested by the car's inner dynamics.\u000a Nevertheless, you're not going to be spared jitters in some of the country's more ruthless road formats, but otherwise ride condition was good. \u000aThe front axle of the chassis is rigged with a McPherson strut. The presence of a torsion stabiliser and lower triangular links helps keep the ride calm. The rear axle has been compounded with a multi-element axle that also comes with a torsion stabiliser. Along with this, a longitudinal and three transverse links further elevate the ride comfort\u000a. As for the braking capacity, we had no problems pushing the vehicle through tight turns and tense corners, and stopping distance was also easily achieved. The hydraulic dual-diagonal circuit braking system comes along with vacuum assist and a dual rate system. Disc brakes have been clamped onto all wheels, with the front brakes also getting inner cooling and a single piston floating caliper.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aSafety:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe new edition comes with parking sensors that helps reversing easie\u000ar and flawless. \u000aApart from this, we found the\u000a safety area to be nearly impeccable\u000a, with a broad range of security features that \u000atouch nearly every aspect of the ride. \u000aAnti-lock braking system, Electronic brake force distribution system, Mechanical brake assist, Hydraulic brake assist, Anti slip regulation and many other\u000a drive programs\u000a help to seal control and stability when driving.\u000a A robust airbag system shields\u000a the occupants, including dual front airbags, curtain airbags and side airbags. We thought that the restraint system was also up to the mark, with the presence of pretensioners and active front head restraints. Apart from all this, the dynamic lighting system helps to prevent mishaps. It includes an adaptive front-light system, Bi-Xenon headlamps that come along with headlamp levelling function, fog lamps that come along with a cornering function and warning indicators on all doors.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVariants:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere are two trim levels \u000ain the model series\u000a, Style and L&K. \u000aThere are features shared by both trim levels and features unique to each of them as well. \u000aStyle comes with some exclusive features, such as a chrome door sill with \u2018Superb Inscription\u2019, Stone Beige leather upholstery and Helios alloy wheels that grant a more distinctive outer look. On the inside, this variant gets an eight speaker audio system and a MaxiDot multi-function that displays travelling time, fuel consumption, distance travelled, average speed, etc. Meanwhile, the higher end L&K trim comes with many exclusive features, such as a fatigue detection driver assist, 12-way adjustable front passenger seat, a 12-speaker Canton sound system, a tyre pressure monitoring system, a 3-zone climatronic temperature control, air conditioned front seats, an electronically controlled 5th door.\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVerdict:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWith the new edition of Skoda Superb, the industry gets a new benchmark to strive towards. This is a car with great promise and we thought that the company has done a great job giving it a new and refreshed aura altogether. The Superb\u2019s spacious set-up, \u000aexcess of comfort features\u000a, its \u000astrong safety sector\u000a and its glamorous\u000a exterior cover\u000a together are sure to go well with customers. However, it does have some let-downs as well: \u000aIts hefty price tag and its engine performance would certainly ward off those looking for some real fervour in the ride\u000a. At the end of the day, the Superb is for you if you're looking for a \u000amoderately comfortable driving experience. \u000aMeanwhile, for the thriftier lot and for those looking for an over-the-top ride experience, we'd recommend something else.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a

First-in-segment features like Tilt Steering & Driver Side Airbag2. Available in 0.8l & 1.0l engine variants.ExteriorHyundai Eon is the smallest car to get the company\u2019s fluidic design and the design philosophy shines the best through the car. Eon could be the car with most curves and lines in its segment, or a segment higher for that matter.Heads-on, the Hyundai Eon gets swept back headlamps with a neat chrome strip adorning the Hyundai logo. The hexagonal grille is also a part of the front bumper which is really big and gives a macho look to the front of the Eon.Sculpted bonnet and neatly designed fog lamps are a rarity for the cars in this segment.Come to the side and see the fluidic design flow through the car with beefed up wheel arches, a shoulder line that runs from the headlamps to the tail. Another sculpted line runs the length of the car between the front and rear wheels.The shoulder line scoop upward towards the rear that makes the side profile sportier but rear window visibility is compromised. Even the door handles follow the shoulder line\u2019s path with the rear door handles positioned slightly higher than the front ones.To the rear, the large tail lamps are well designed, following the car\u2019s extroversive character. The rear glass is pretty wide and the rear spoiler is neatly integrated.The rear bumper is pretty meaty but is a size bigger than necessary, also making the boot less accessible by that much. The exhaust pipe is neatly hidden  underneath the rear bumper, allowing for a neat layout.The Eon gets 145mm tyres with 12 inch rims for the D-Lite, D-Lite+, and ERA+ variants and 155mm tyres with larger 13 inch rims on Magna+ and Sportz variants. Both are pretty skinny and we recommend an upgrade to 165 or wider tyres for safety.InteriorsGet inside and you will be greeted by one of the best designed interiors with the quality of the fit and finish matching it. The Eon gets the segment\u2019s best looking dashboard (equalled by the recently launched Renault Kwid maybe) and it\u2019s hard to believe in this segment. Hyundai has upheld its reputation of putting the best looking interiors with amazing build quality.The interiors get a black and beige layout. The dashboard is spread like the wings of a bird with a V shaped centre console.The instrument cluster features a large circular pod that houses the speedometer and a MID at the bottom, displaying the odometer, trip meter and shift indicator. There are two small circular pods on either side showing the fuel level and engine temperature gauges. Overall, the meters are easily readable and are designed neatly. The lack of a tachometer is easily felt and there is no option for the same even in the top variants.The steering wheel is nicely designed with a V-shaped silver highlight in the middle and is of a good size, if not a tad bigger. The steering wheel also gets a first-in-segment tilt adjustment.The centre console houses the middle AC vents and a 2-DIN audio system and air conditioning controls below. The switches and knobs are of good size and quality.The glove box is wide and deep, offering lots of space for your needs. Other storage spaces come in the form of a storage spot on the top of the dashboard, bottle holders on the front doors, door pockets and cup holders in the middle.Both the front and rear seats offer amazing under thigh support especially in this segment. The front seats get integrated headrests that are positioned very efficiently and the cushioning is also good. At the rear, the space available is one of the best in the segment (not surprising considering that the Eon gets the same wheelbase as the Santro and i10).215 litres of boot space means you can travel with your luggage neatly tucked in the rear. The boot space is one of the biggest in the segment miles ahead of the Alto\u2019s 177 liters and Nanos abysmal 80 liters. Only the newly released Renault Kwid beats the Eon as its boot space stands at 300 liters.\u000a PerformanceThe Hyundai Eon is now available in two petrol engine options - 0.8L iRDE engine and 1.0L Kappa engine.Eon 0.8L iRDEThe Hyundai Eon 0.8L iRDE is powered by a 814 cc, 3-cylinder petrol engine that puts out 55 bhp of maximum power at 5500 rpm and 76 Nm of maximum torque at 4000 rpm. It is the same unit that powers the i10 in a downsized form with a cylinder chopped off, mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox. The engine is nicely refined but still you can feel the engine upon starting it through the gear lever.The engine is designed to offer maximum fuel economy, so don\u2019t expect outright performance. The 3-cylinder unit is best suited for city driving. The throttle response and low end power delivery is not bad. The engine responds nicely to short bursts of acceleration and can cruise in the highways around 120 km/h without any hassle. But be it the traffic laden city roads or the highways, the gearbox demands a healthy workout from you to extract the performance you expect.The clutch is one of the lightest that you can experience and mix that to the light steering and the city driving will be effortless. The steering is a tad too light to our liking and this proves to be a problem on the highways when you are cruising in triple digit speeds. The lack of feedback from the steering can be frightening at high speeds around the curves.\u000a\u000a \u000a Eon 1.0L KappaHyundai also added the 1.0-litre Kappa engine to the Eon range to compete better with the Alto, which is available with a 0.8-litre and a 1.0-litre engine option. The Eon 1.0-litre Kappa is powered by a 998 cc, 3-cylinder petrol engine that makes 68 bhp at 6200 rpm and a peak torque of 94 Nm at 3500 rpm.Mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox, the Eon 1.0L is for those who think that the 0.8L Eon is a bit slow. Though not by a large margin, the 1.0-L does offer a bit more zippy engine and Hyundai has also taken care of the jerkiness that you experience with the smaller engine.\u000a\u000aThere are no other changes mechanically and the Eon 1.0L behaves the same like the 0.8L but with a bit more briskness. The Eon 1.0L is only available in Magna+ (O) variant.Ride and HandlingAs far as the ride quality and handling characteristics are concerned, both the 0.8L and 1.0L behave similarly as there are no differences in the suspension setup. The Hyundai Eon gets the typical McPherson strut to the front and torsion beam axle to the rear for the suspension duties. While the Eon goes smooth as long as the roads are smooth and can absorb slight aberrations of without a problem. But as the going gets tough, the Eon does get going but you will feel each and every bit of those large bumps.When it comes to handling, predictable is the word that describes that of the Eon. Hyundai Eon doe a neat job of going around the city traffic without any drama. Over the highways, while the straight line stability is good, going around the curves will rob you off the confidence. The skinny tyres are the major reason and hence we recommend wider tyre upgrade at the earliest. The tyres take no time to understeer if pushed hard and the body roll also crops in.While the light steering is good for the city commutes, the feedback from it is almost nonexistent on the highways. The brakes though have a nice bite to them and inspire confidence during high speed braking situations.SafetyThe safety features of the Hyundai Eon include reinforced body structure, front and rear seat belts, child safety rear door locks, engine immobilizer, front fog lamps and driver airbag in one variant (Sportz).\u000a\u000a VariantsHyundai Eon is available in six variants - five for the 0.8L version D-Lite, D-Lite+, Era+, Magna+ and Sprotz; and one Magna+ (O) for the 1.0-L version.The D-Lite variant is the most basic variant with front and rear seat belts, engine immobilizer, integrated spoiler, bench folding rear seat, dual trip meter, remote fuel lid opener and tailgate release.With D-Lite+, you get front speaker grille and the much needed air conditioner and power steering.The Era+ variant offers you the option for choosing a LPG fuel source apart from tinted glass, body colour bumper, silver touch on center fascia, front door map with bottle holder, power outlet, front power windows and front door armrest.Our favorite pick of the lot is the Magna+which is offered with central locking, internally adjustable wing mirrors, passenger side win mirror, tilt steering, roof antenna, front and rear speaker grille, rear parcel tray and 2 DIN Radio+MP3 Audio.The top end Sportz gets you keyless entry, front fog lamps, driver airbag, body coloured ORVMs and door handles and metallic finish 3-Spoke steering wheel.The Magna+ (O) features that are a couple of segments above like keyless entry and also includes front fog lamps, body coloured wing mirrors and door handles.VerdictHyundai Eon brings to the table what the other cars have failed to at the same time inspired other companies (read Renault with their Kwid) to bring a great looking car that offers best-in-class build quality, good fuel economy and lots of features in this segment. In typical Hyundai way.The Eon is certainly eons ahead of what the Alto offers and is almost head on with the Renault Kwid. So close, that we couldn\u2019t come to a conclusion between the two. The biggest advantage the Eon holds over the Kwid is that it's available without a waiting period, however the Kwid is more appealing as it is the new k(w)id on the block.

The manual versions of this vehicle have a kerb weight of 1010 kgs, while it is 1085 kgs in the automatic and diesel versions.Editor's take :\u000a The Scala has been designed for those who will like to be driven to work and will drive out with friends. Hence, there is an acre of space at the rear, and good enough room for head and legs in the front as well.\u000a  This sedan series is quite classy and has been designed with various comfort features. The mid and top end trims have Beige colored interiors, while the base trim is in dark Grey color that add to its appeal. It has a leather wrapped steering wheel mounted with audio controls, which makes it convenient for the driver. The gear knob is also wrapped in leather, which makes it look stylish.

It also has ample leg room for all its occupants along with decent head and shoulder space as well.Editor's take :\u000a The acceleration of both the cars is good, however the petrol has an edge when both are compared. In overall, it is the diesel which will our pick.\u000a The petrol engine is coupled with an efficient five speed manual and an X-Tronic CVT automatic transmission gear box as well. The manual versions can cross the speed mark of 100 Kmph in around 13.58 seconds, while attaining a top speed of about 155 Kmph, which is rather decent. The automatic trims can achieve an impressive top speed of 160 Kmph approximately and accelerates from 0 to 100 Kmph in close to 12.11 seconds from a standstill. Whereas, the diesel variants take around 16 seconds to break the 100 Kmph speed barrier and attains a top speed in the range of 160 to 165 Kmph, which is not bad at all. \u000a  Editor's take :\u000a Both the engine offerings on the Scala aren\u2019t good on paper, but even in the real world. Our pick of the lot is the diesel for its linear power delivery and low NVH.\u000a  The automaker has incorporated both petrol and diesel engines in this sedan series. The petrol variants have a 1.5-litre, XH2 engine that has the ability to displace 1498cc. It carries 4-cylinders, sixteen valves and is incorporated with an electronic fuel injection system. This dual overhead camshaft valve configuration based motor can generate a peak power of 97.64bhp at 6000rpm along with a torque output of 134Nm at 4000rpm. The powerful 1.5-litre diesel engine is based on a single overhead camshaft valve configuration. It has four cylinders that are further fitted with eight valves in it. This mill displaces 1461cc and is integrated with a common rail direct fuel injection system. The maximum power churned out by this motor is 84.8bhp at 3750rpm and generates 200Nm torque output. Both these power plants are coupled with a five speed manual transmission gear box. Meanwhile, the petrol engine is also available with an X-Tronic CVT transmission gear box. This automatic version can belt out a peak power and torque of 99.61bhp at 5600rpm and 134Nm at 4000rpm.Editor's take :\u000a The Scala\u2019s petrol engine is quite efficient while the K9K diesel is one o the most frugal mills that are sold in India. The K9K is certainly the pick of the lot.\u000a  As certified by the ARAI, its diesel mill can return a healthy fuel economy of 21.64 Kmpl on the expressways, which is quite good. Whereas, it comes down to around 18.5 Kmpl within the city. On the other hand, its petrol power plant can deliver a maximum mileage of 16.95 Kmpl on the bigger roads and returns around 13.5 Kmpl under city traffic conditions. Meanwhile, the automatic versions can deliver a mileage of 17.97 Kmpl and around 14 Kmpl on the highways and city roads respectively.Editor's take :\u000a The power on both these motors is good and so is the delivery fairly linear. There is no sign of turbo lag in the diesel.\u000a Its petrol motor belts out a maximum power of 97.64bhp at 6000rpm and yields a peak torque output of 134Nm at 4000rpm, which is rather good. The CVT version can generate a peak power of 99.61bhp and delivers the same torque output as the manual version. On the other hand, its commanding diesel mill has the ability to pump out a maximum power of 84.8bhp at 3750rpm. At the same time, it generates a superior torque output of 200Nm at 2000rpm, which is quite impressive.Editor's take :\u000a The Scala comes loaded in-dash music system, leather interiors, keyless entry, push start and stop, electrically folding ORVMs.\u000a  In order to provide best in-car entertainment to its passengers, the manufacturer has installed a music system in this sedan. It features a CD, MP3 player, AM/FM radio tuner and has four speakers, which are located in the front and rear side of the cabin. This integrated audio unit also supports auxiliary input options, which is quite good. It also has a roof mounted antenna for reception of radio signals, while the power steering wheel is mounted with audio control switches in the mid and high end trims. On the other hand, the owners of this sedan have an option to customize with a few additional aspects, which are of their requirement. Some of the interior features include steering wheel cover, black and beige carpet mat, art leather seat covers, reverse park assist, luggage mat, black as well as transparent rubber mat, illuminated scuff plates and a comfort set featuring seat cushions, neck rest and seat belt pad. The list of exterior features include mud flaps, exhaust finisher, silver car cover, blinkers on ORVMs, body side molding, wind deflector and a few other such aspects.Editor's take :\u000a The handling characteristics of the Scala are decent, as the suspension has been tuned for better ride than handling. There is some amount of body roll, thanks to the long travel of the suspension.\u000a  The suspension and braking sedan is said to be safe and sound in every way. The front wheels have been equipped with McPherson struts, while the rear end gets a torsion beam. This system is efficient enough to absorb most of the jerks, which are usually felt while driving on Indian roads. On the brakes front, the car features disk brakes on the front and drum brakes on the rear. The responsive power steering is firm and is accompanied with a turning radius of 5.30 meters. The electronic brake distribution system together with anti lock braking system makes the braking system much more efficient. All this put together makes this sedan one of the most reliable vehicle to travel in.Editor's take :\u000a The safety features on the Scala are the dual airbags for passive, while ABS is the active safety feature.\u000a  This latest version of sedan is equipped with quite a lot of crucial protective aspects. The company has equipped it with an advanced anti lock braking system that comes along with an electronic brake distribution system as well. Then there are dual front airbags for both the mid and top end trims, whereas the base variant only gets a driver airbag. Apart from these, it also has emergency brake assist , speed sensing auto door locks, adjustable head restraints (front and rear), rear window defroster with timer, anti pinch power window on driver-side (one touch up and down), an advanced engine immobilizer for stopping any unauthorized entry, variable intermittent front wipers with washer and smoked style headlamps. All these put together makes this sedan series, one of the most sought after and safe.The astutely carved out wheel arches of the mid and top end trims have been equipped with a classy set of 15 inch alloy wheels. These stylish rims are further covered with radial tubeless tyres of size 185/65 R15, which provides a perfect grip of the road. Whereas, the base trim has been given a set of robust 14 inch steel wheels that have been covered with trendy full wheel covers, which are equipped with similar tubeless radials of size 185/70 R14.1. Roomy leg space with spacious interiors.2. Attractive exterior aspects and appearance.3. Innovative comfort features equipped in its top end trim.4. Even the CVT trims have decent fuel economy.5. Its diesel engine performance is very impressive.1. Acceleration and pickup can be made better.2. The NVH levels of its diesel engine can be reduced.3. Initial cost of ownership can be further competitive.4. Safety standards can be improved.5. After sales service is not up to the mark.

VIntroductionThe Figo enters it\u2019s second generation, taking over the reins from what was Ford\u2019s most successful hatch in the country. The 2015 iteration is more powerful, safer and looks as modern as it should. Let\u2019s take a quick look at what the little Ford has to offer.Pros1. Proportions. Just the right size for the city. 2. 100 PS Diesel engine is frugal as well as fun to drive. 3. Safety - dual airbags standard, 6 airbags on the top-specCons1. Petrol motor lacks punch. Strictly an intra-city runabout.2. Interior quality isn\u2019t the best, feels flimsy. Rivals like the Grand i10 have much better interiors.3. Automatic not offered in the top-spec variant, thus misses out on some good-to-have features.Stand Out Features1.Ford MyKey : Programmable second key to set a speed limit; volume limit. Unique to the Figo. Useful when you want to hand the car to someone who\u2019s just learnt how to drive. 2.Six-airbags is a segment benchmark. Unheard of in a sub 10 lakh rupee hatchback.ExteriorThe older Figo was termed \u2018boring\u2019 by the majority, purely because of the way it was styled. This one however, isn\u2019t boring in any sense of the word. The front gets large swept-back headlamps and a gaping grille that might remind you of certain Aston Martins. The foglamps are tucked away on the lower half of the bumper, but they look a size smaller than what would have suited the Ford.The side sees a distinct shoulder line running across the length of the car and a large window area. The window line swoops up as it passes the rear door and ends into a rather thick C-pillar. The turn indicators are placed neatly on the wing mirrors, which is a neat touch. The only aspect that let\u2019s the design of the Figo down, have to be the puny 14 inch alloys. The hatch could\u2019ve definitely done with a bigger and better set of wheels. \u000aThe large bumper takes up most of the real-estate at the rear. It is minimalistic to say the least. The reverse lamps, rear fog lights are integrated into the tail-light assembly itself which ends up freeing a lot of space on the rear end. It could\u2019ve done with a pair of reflectors on the bumper to break up the bulk.Dimension wise, the Ford is the largest car in its class. It also gets the largest wheelbase. Surprisingly, the ground clearance is better than the \u2018micro SUV\u2019 aka KUV1OO.The Figo won\u2019t be winning any design awards. At the same time, it wouldn\u2019t draw polarising opinions either. It is available in seven different colors and has the right mix of straights & curves. We can say that Ford has definitely played it\u2019s design cards safe.InteriorAmongst the first things you notice is how the low the car is. Elderly folks will most definitely have a problem getting used to the low slung seating. The interior is a very familiar place to be, especially if you\u2019ve been in a Ford recently. The Figo ditches the black and beige theme that the Aspire carries for a cleaner all black layout. There\u2019s a splatter of silver on the centre console and some chrome around the AC vents to break the monotony of black. The seats are upholstered in good quality fabric. Although we would have loved to see leather interiors from the Aspire, the Figo does just enough to justify it\u2019s price. The front seats are a nice place to be - they are really supportive. That said, a little more cushioning wouldn\u2019t have hurt. The driver\u2019s seat gets adjust for height as well as reach, whereas the steering can be adjusted only for the tilt. Inspite of the lack of reach adjust on the steering wheel, getting into a comfortable driving position isn\u2019t too much of a task. \u000aThe rear bench is flat, and could certainly do with a little more cushioning as well. The seats will accommodate  2 people at best, the 3rd passenger will be a bit of a squeeze for the Ford. Lastly, unlike the Grand i10, the Ford misses out on rear ac vents and a central armrest, but it isn\u2019t a major deal-breaker. The top-spec Titanium+ variant of the Figo comes all that you could ask for in a hatch from this segment. It gets automatic climate control, which is an absolute boon in the sweltering heat that our country is known for. It also gets a button that is marked MAX A/C that chills the cabin down very quickly. Talking of entertainment, the Figo gets an integrated music system with bluetooth, AUX and USB connectivity as well. It also gets Ford\u2019s SYNC system that lets you use voice commands to place a call or play music. The steering, is borrowed from the Ecosport and houses buttons for the telephony and the calls. It has a grainy texture which lets the driver have a firm grip. However, the steering is a bit too light by Ford standards - more on that later. If you opt for the Titanium variant; you will miss out on the screen for the system and Ford\u2019s SYNC system. In place, you get a dock for your phone instead. The arrangement, dubbed MyDock is a super-convenient place to dock the phone while playing music or using navigation on the device. The Figo offers all that you need in a hatch from this segment. It has enough space for seating four, a lot of cubby holes around the cabin for the knick knacks and gets a fairly large 257 litre boot for the luggage. The only flaw has to be the build quality, which isn\u2019t as plush as the Grand i10 or even the Bolt for that matter. Overlook that, and the Figo is amongst the most cleverly packaged hatchbacks in the market today.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEngine and PerformanceThe Ford Figo is available with a choice of two petrol engines and one diesel. While the large petrol engine is available only with a 6-speed dual clutch automatic gearbox, the other two engines come mated to a five speed manual gearbox.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1.2 litre Ti-VCTThe 1.2 litre petrol engine, is best suited for the city. Out on the highways it definitely lacks punch. The motor needs to be revved really hard since the meat of the power is at the top of the rev range. Another peculiar thing we noticed was how audible the engine was at high revs. When driven sedately, it does return decent fuel economy. It is nothing more than a commuter class engine, that does it\u2019s duty well. The benchmark petrol engine in the segment, continues to be the 1.2 litre K-Series motor harbored in the Swift\u2019s engine bay. 1.5 litre Ti-VCTThis engine is available only with the 6 - speed dual clutch automatic transmission, in the Titanium trim. While it might make the Figo look like a hot hatch on paper, the 1.5 Ti-VCT fails to deliver on counts of performance. There just isn\u2019t enough torque for the gearbox to exploit and deliver. Where the engine and gearbox combo do score however, is in terms of sheer convenience. When driven with a light foot, the automatic keeps the wallet happy too. The engine and gearbox combo is definitely miles better than the only other petrol automatic in the segment - the Hyundai Grand i10.1.5 litre TDCiThe diesel engine is the one to pick if you enjoy driving. The 100PS power figure, coupled with the light body and compact proportions make it quite the pocket rocket. Low end torque is impressive and the engine pulls cleanly as the revvs climb. Issues with this engine remain the NVH levels inside the cabin, but that is a something that can be overlooked due to the immense potential the engine possesses. The diesel Figo is amongst the rare cars that can be fun and frugal at the same timeRide and Handling\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe suspension is noticeably softer than the Swift. The suspension is tuned for comfort which lets the Ford soak in the bumps easily. That said, the rear passengers get thrown about quite a bit over broken roads. The electronic power steering is almost too light by Ford standards. Compared to the old gen Figo\u2019s hydraulic unit - this one fails to deliver in terms of feel and feedback. While it is an absolute boon in bumper-to-bumper traffic, but can be slightly unnerving whilst doing triple digit speeds on the highway. Throw the Figo into a fast corner and it doesn\u2019t upset. However, we would recommend getting some fat rubber before doing so. The stock tyre profile does not do much in terms of grip. Braking duties are handled by disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. The Figo holds it\u2019s line under harsh braking. Also, pedal feedback is very good. We didn\u2019t have any issues with the brakes even after multiple rounds of testing. VariantsThe Figo is offered in a total of 5 variants. The base variant is a no-frills hatch which has essentials such as air-conditioning covered. The Ambiente version gets Dual Airbags as standard. It also gets a passenger side mirror, front power windows and silver detailing on the grille. If you are on an absolute budget, pick the Ambiente since it has a basic safety net in place. The trend variant gets some convenience features like remote unlock and a four-speaker audio system with steering mounted controls. It also gets indicators on the wing-mirrors and all four power windows. The Titanium spec sees the Figo get front foglamps, rear defogger and climate control. Most importantly, it gets ABS with EBD. The top-spec Titanium+ variant is full loaded, getting goodies such as a side and curtain airbags, a 4.2 inch screen for the music system and voice command as well.Safety\u000aOn the safety front, the Figo is the only hatch to get six - airbags in the top-spec Titanium+ Variant. Dual airbags are standard across the range. It also gets ABS with EBD; and with the Automatic the Ford is equipped with Hill Launch Assist and ESP as well. VerdictThe Ford Figo makes for a nice city commuter. In different guises, it offers convenience, frugality and is fun to drive too. There are certain inconsistencies in quality both on the inside and out; but it isn\u2019t a deal breaker in any manner whatsoever. The Figo is a well - rounded hatch for the city. The petrol engines are refined and will lap up the city commutes with ease. If \u2018Fun To Drive\u2019 is a must-have on your checklist for the next car, the diesel is the one for you.  Overall, the Figo comes across as a really competitive alternative to the Grand i10, Bolt and the Swift.

The latest upgrades are additional features which are limited only to its top-spec Highline grade. Aside from that, it receives no changes on the exterior, technical or interior front. One of the new aspects on board is the mirror link connectivity that will reflect your phone's screen onto the audio unit display. Another feature is the rain sensor, which is now integrated to the auto dimming IRVM. Safety wise, it carries the same attributes that were present in the outgoing model. Some of them include electronic engine immobilizer, electronic stabilization program, and three point seat belts as well. On the other hand, three engine options are on offer to choose from. Of which, two are petrol and the other one is a diesel motor. All these are tuned to deliver exceptional performance on roads besides making good power and torque output. In this segment, it locks horns with other best sellers in the market like Honda City, Hyundai Verna and Maruti Ciaz. The next offering from this brand will be the Ameo, which is all set for its debut in the Auto Expo 2016. It is likely that this new model will carry most of the elements that are present in the Vento.Background & EvolutionVolkswagen India had started the production of Vento in 2010 in its Pune plant. It was introduced in three trim levels \u2013 Trendline, Comfortline and Highline. This model is technically, a stretched version of its hatchback sibling Volkswagen Polo. Even then, it was offered with both petrol and diesel engine options. The firm went on to add a separate TSI model with a 1.2-litre TSI motor that was borrowed from the Polo. This sedan managed to impress many with features like automatic climate control and a touchscreen radio to name a few. In 2013, the manufacturer came up with the \u201cStyle\u201d limited edition trim and next, it was the \u201cKonekt Edition\u201d in 2014. Meanwhile, the model received a facelift in 2015 with some changes made to its interiors, and exteriors. This year's facelift brings it some additional aspects, which have been missing in all its predecessors.ExteriorVento has always been a smart sedan, which owns a design that is both elegant and stylish. The 2016 version does not receive any changes to its outsides. However, it carries some attractive elements that make it a head turner on roads.In terms of dimensions, its rival Maruti Ciaz is 100mm longer and 31mm wider than Volkswagen Vento. As for the height, all its competitors are ahead of Vento. Even the ground clearance and wheelbase measurements are less than all other models.On the front, the first thing to catch your attention is definitely the wide radiator grille featuring three horizontally positioned slats. What highlights it further is the attractive logo, which sits exactly at the center of the grille. The neat chrome finishing to thin slats as well as insignia makes it look more striking.The black finished halogen headlamps on either side of the grille is another element thats worth mentioning. Being large in size, its headlight cluster fits well with the design of its grille. In the mid and top spec trims, dual beam headlamps are also on the offer.Made of a heat insulating glass, its windscreen now gets rain sensing wipers thus, making the view more clear ahead. Talking about the bonnet, it slopes downward, while the minimal creases which gives it an appealing look.Nothing much to describe in its side profile except for the 15-inch Zirkonia alloy wheels that come adorned with high performance tubeless tyres of size 185/60 R145. Tubeless tyres of same size are used for the Comfortline grade as well. While the rest of the lineup gets robust steel rims, which are sized 14 inches in the Trendline trims. These radial tubeless tyres bear the size 175/70 R14.Well designed outside rear view mirrors are also on the list, which gets neat body color. Side turn indicators are given as standard in all the variants.This sedan does look plain and lacks some style in its rear end however, a few aspects make it somewhat interesting to look at.The taillight cluster is quite bright and comes integrated with 3D effect lamps along with turn indicators.The bumper in its rear end is neatly carved, while the boot lid is embossed with company's insignia and gives a good impression to the on-lookers.Coming to its boot compartment, it measures around 494 liters, which is indeed enough for placing a number of bags. However, Honda and Maruti are comparatively better in this point as, they are offering more luggage storage space than Vento.InteriorThe design of its internal section is left untouched in this facelift, however, some advanced equipments can be seen inside, adding to its features list. The cabin is neat good quality plastic materials and has space for five people who can feel convenient with ample head, leg as well as shoulder room.Inside the car, you can actually see the excellent work of the company's designers who have combined the dual tone color scheme and chrome elements to give it an elegant look. Especially, if you take a look at the dashboard, it looks so well designed and even the equipments are properly positioned thus, making it more convenient for the driver to control different functions with much ease.A stylish center console sits at the center of the dashboard carrying aspects like the climatronic automatic air conditioning unit with rectangular shaped air vents, which are placed just above the music system. Dust, pollen filter and rear AC vent is also available.Undoubtedly, one of the important updates it has received is the dynamic infotainment display. This advanced unit is offered with a touchscreen display and also includes radio, navigation system and a few other functions. Meanwhile, the mirror link connectivity is definitely an add-on that lets you connect your phone to the car and access different functions effortlessly.A power assisted steering column is on offer with tilt and telescopic adjustment functions that aid the driver in adjusting its position accordingly. Exactly behind it is a stylish instrument cluster that also holds a tachometer, tripmeter, as well as speedometer.PerformanceDieselThe diesel versions have a 1.5-litre turbocharged oil burner that is based on a DOHC valve configuration. This engine makes a peak power of 103.5bhp besides yielding torque of 250Nm. Here, the added benefit is the availability of both 5-speed manual and 7-speed DSG automatic transmission gear box options. Also, it gives a good mileage of about 20.64 Kmpl in the manual trims, while this figure is even better in the AT variants where the fuel economy comes to 21.5 Kmpl approximately.PetrolThe naturally aspirated 1.6-litre petrol engine is one among the two options offered in this model. It produces 103.5bhp and 153Nm torque besides returning a mileage of around 16.09 Kmpl. This one comes with a 5-speed manual transmission gear box. Also on the offer is the 1.2-litre petrol mill, which also generates the same power but delivers torque of 175Nm between 1500 to 4100rpm. This mill is mated with a 7-speed DSG automatic transmission gear box that drives power to its front wheels.Ride and HandlingAs for the braking, a robust set of ventilated disc brakes are fitted to its front wheels and the rear ones get sturdy drum brakes. Anti lock braking mechanism is also offered that not only boosts this mechanism but also prevents the vehicle from skidding. Meanwhile, the McPherson strut on front axle and semi-independent trailing arm on the rear one makes your journey in this sedan quite comfortable. This suspension system ensures the ride is smooth no matter how the road conditions are. On the other hand, with a speed sensing electronic power steering column, you can easily take turns besides having good control at both low and high speeds.SafetySafety elements are up to the mark in this upgraded Vento. In the entry level models, you will find aspects like dual front airbags, three point seat belts that are height adjustable at front, and electronic engine immobilizer with floating code. The rear parking sensors does the job of alerting the driver about any obstacle through audible signals, while the front and rear adjustable head restraints offers support and protection to your neck. Whereas the mid and top spec variants additionally gets hill hold control, and power windows with pinch guard function on all doors. Besides these, the advanced attributes like anti lock braking system as well as electronic stabilization program takes the security standards to next level.VariantsThis model series is presently offered in three trim levels.Its base level Trendline trim does have an array of features, which are quite good for the price range it carries. Key elements like a multi function display, driver seat with adjustment facility and sporty flat-bottom steering wheel are present in this model.In case of Comfortline variant, you will get to see a few more additional aspects like cruise control, remote central locking, and 15-inch steel rims.The advanced and newly added features are present in the top end Highline trim, which comes with Mirror link connectivity, auto dimming inside rear view mirror, and has steering mounted audio controls as well.VerdictWe at CarDekho, would opine that it is quite disappointing that this facelifted Volkswagen Vento lacks updates to its exteriors, interiors and technical details as well. There is no doubt that with new offerings and improvements, this automaker is continuously putting efforts to raise the standards in the market. But just adding a few new attributes may not impress many buyers keeping in view, the upcoming Auto Expo and considering the new aspects with which all other manufacturers are coming with. However, if the price and performance parameters are prioritized, it may still remain a preferred choice of a certain section of customers.

VThe \u000aMahindra Ssanyong Rexton\u000a is a muscular looking SUV series, that is available only in a diesel guise and with 3 variants. One of them is an automatic trim. Though it is a utility vehicle, the manufacturers have taken care in making it appealing with its external design, which can be noticed in the first glance itself. Its skin carries a chrome based radiator grille, eagle eye shaped headlamps, body toned bumpers with a couple of integrated fog lamps, a set of 16-inch, 10-spoke alloys along with sporty rear spoiler and a specially designed company emblem. The most significant aspect of any utility vehicle is its performance, then the safety quotient and its carrying capacity. First in line, the performance is not compromised as it has an all wheel drive mechanism and an intelligent 4x4 torque-on-demand system with a low ratio and an ability to accelerate up to speeds of about 180 to 194 Kmph. Its braking mechanism is supported by ABS and EBD along with electronic stability program and hill descent control plus disc brakes to all wheels among others. Pertaining to the safety quotient of this vehicle and the occupants in it, the overall body is made up of reinforced steel panels and crumple zones to distribute the collision impact force without crushing the cabin. Additionally, an active slip and active roll-over protection is useful while off-roading particularly. Seatbelts, dual front airbags safeguard occupants from fatal injuries, while an engine immobilizer will keep the vehicle safe from thefts. Next in line is the storage efficiency, which is is justified by a massive 475 litres boot space and an ability to withhold 78 litres in its fuel tank, both beneficial in planning for long journeys. All the rest of its factors will only accord to the comfort present in this series. There are many exclusive features incorporated and one among them is a 3 preset memory storage for the driver seat customized adjustments along with external mirror adjustments according to that particular driver. An infotainment system that can support quite a lot of multimedia functions along with touch capacity screen and video function as well is present. Rain sensing wipers can be of great help during monsoon. Automatic headlamps that work through sensors will be useful during drives on runways especially where switching-on/off in the middle of the drive is not very pleasant. The automatic version not only alleviates the driver's engagement in shifting gears, but also wouldn't allow to even stretch arms any further than the steering wheel. This is enabled in this model by equipping thumbs up/down switches on the gear shift knob and steering wheel to change gears with a lot of ease. Apart from these, there is a speed sensitive power steering with tilt adjustment. The electric sunroof has sun blinds to it, a cigarette lighter is there and there are about 3 sockets with 12V power for charging small electronic devices. Other automated functions are auto dimming inter rear view mirror and sunglass holder, electrically foldable, adjustable plus heated external mirrors. All these contribute not just in making the drive strain-free, but also a pleasure. Company offers an impressive three years or 1,00,000 kilometres of warranty is well known for after-sale service.This SUV looks very robust yet elegant for a utility vehicle. The very structure itself gives an impression of sophistication. Nothing extraordinary is attached to its shell, but whatever is present, is offered in a neat and decent design. Its richness is achieved by its simplicity in its design. On the front, one can see a chrome radiator grille with Rexton emblem sitting over it in style. There are headlamp cluster, which has similarity to an eagle eye on either sides and a simple airdam right below the body toned bumper. The turn indicators integrated outside rear view mirrors and blacked out window sills and pillars give a decent and contrasting appearance to its sides. Spoiler at the rear and rails on the roof are an added decoration. Rear end is further styled by a pair of LED tail lamps with L-shaped parking lights. Overall image is dominated by a classy set of 10-spoke alloy rims fitted to the wheel arches, which are further equipped with tubeless radials.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aExterior Measurements:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIts dimensions are pretty generous and justifying its massive appearance. An overall length is 4755mm along with a total width is about 1900mm. It stands at a height of 1785mm (without roof rails). A ground clearance of 208mm is good enough for a utility vehicle on Indian roads.Ed's Take:\u000a The interiors of the Rexton has spacious and do feel premium. The plastic quality is good and the overall fit and finish is decent. The third row of seats are disappointing as there isn\u2019t any kneeroom.\u000a\u000a\u000a The dual tone black and beige interiors look good as a combination of two colors make an interesting design. One can see metal grain accents all over the cabin. Top end variant is bestowed with leather wrapped steering wheel, gear shift knob and leather seats as well. There are three 12V power sockets \u2013 1 on the dashboard, the other below front passenger seat and another one in the trunk. Reading lamps are fitted to the roof for all three rows. Premium floor mats will keep the cabin clean. An illumination is there for the spacious glove box that can be used to store quite a few things.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInterior Comfort:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA lot of luxury features are incorporated in this vehicle, which justifies its price range. The driver's seat has 8-way electrically adjustable facility along with lumbar support. The outside rear view mirrors can be electrically adjusted, folded and heated as well. A cigarette lighter and an ashtray are also available. Steering wheel can be adjusted and audio controls are mounted onto it that adds to the convenience of its driver. Driver and co-passenger have sun-visors with mirrors and lights. All the rows have air-conditioning vents and the third row has blower controls as well. Sunglass holder, coat hooks and map pockets contribute to the inner storage capacity. Power windows with auto up/down switch for driver side window and keyless entry are other functions that offer added comfortableness.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInterior Measurements:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA wheelbase of about 2,835mm enables to have a spacious cabin in which there is plenty of leg room and shoulder space along with a generous head room which lets even tall occupants seat comfortably. The boot space can contain 475 litres within it and the fuel tank capacity is of 78 litres.Ed's Take:\u000a Despite being such large in size, the Rexton has good acceleration. The drivability is decent too.\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a The manual transmission trims can accelerate to a top speed of 180 Kmph and can breach the 100 Kmph mark from naught in just 11 seconds. While the 5-speed automatic transmission gear box can make this mark of 100 Kmph from scratch in much lesser time of about 9 seconds. They are expected to reach a maximum speed of 194 Kmph.Ed's Take:\u000a The automatic transmission has a more powerful engine. But the transmission does blunt the performance of the engine. However, overall it\u2019s a decent package and the power of the engine is at par when compared to competition. The manual RX6 is the pick of the lot.\u000a The 2.7 litre diesel engine is mated to a 5-speed manual transmission gear box and has five cylinders along with 20 valves. This is further coupled with a turbo charger and can generate a power of 162bhp at 4000rpm and a pounding torque output of 340Nm between the range of 1800 to 3250rpm. Based on a common rail direct injection fuel supply system, it has a fuel efficiency of 12.4 Kmpl on bigger roads and this is minimized to about 9.4 Kmpl within the city, when driven under standard driving conditions. It gears upto 180 Kmph maximum speed and breaches the 100 Kmph mark in just about 11 seconds. The other variant which is offered with a 5 speed automatic transmission gear box is incorporated with the same engine. This motor generates a power of 184bhp at 4000rpm and a thumping peak torque output of 402Nm at 1600 to 3000rpm. It touches 100 Kmph mark in 9 seconds and can reach a maximum speed of 194 Kmph. A fuel economy of 8.18 Kmpl in the city and 11.18 Kmpl on highways can be expected.Ed's Take:\u000a The Rexton has decent fuel economy on the manual. The efficiency on the auto mode isn\u2019t that bad either.\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a All its trims run based on a common rail direct injection fuel supply system. The manual gear box variants have a mileage of 9.4 Kmpl in the city that stretches up to 12.4 Kmpl on highways. While the automated gear box trim is efficient enough to deliver 11.18 Kmpl on runways and limits to 8.18 Kmpl under the standard driving conditions.Ed's Take:\u000a The power of the Rexton automatic is good, despite the sluggish nature of the gearbox. The manual has a new variant RX6, which isn\u2019t permanent four-wheel drive.All its variants have a displacement capacity of 2696cc. The trims mated to a manual transmission gear box can generate a maximum power of 162bhp at 4000rpm and a torque of 340Nm at 1800 to 3250rpm. On the other hand, the automatic version can produce 184bhp at 4000rpm and a peak torque output of 402Nm at 1600 to 3000rpm.Ed's Take:\u000a The Rexton comes loaded with leather seats, electrically adjustable front seats, gear controls on the steering also. It has electric sunroof, infotainment system with navigation, automatic headlamps and rain sensing wipers.\u000a\u000a\u000a There is an audio unit with touchscreen infotainment system, which supports MP3, DVD, USB port and also has a Aux-in interface. A video function and a navigation system with pre-loaded maps is also offered. Customers can customize their vehicle by incorporating leather seating to interiors, decals to external body among many other such options depending on their requirement.Ed's Take:\u000a The ride of the Rexton is composed and it feels like a premium SUV cabin, as it doesn\u2019t jitter. Even the handling is decent for the size of the vehicle.\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a Any SUV is highly dependent on these two aspects, which are the maneuverability and braking. Taking this into consideration, the company has equipped a set of adept ventilated disc brakes that further have high performance calipers to its front wheels. While a pair of conventional disc brakes have been fitted to the rear wheels that generates proficient stopping power. To further enhance this mechanism, this UV series have been integrated with anti lock braking system as well. Pertaining to its suspension, a double wishbone is given to its front axle, whereas, the hind axle gets a 5 link mechanism. Raising the bar in this section are the anti roll bars given to both axles that helps this massive vehicle to deal with all the bumps and jerks on the roads. Maneuverability is quite slick with a responsive power assisted steering wheel, which have a speed related feature that gives a meticulous response and supports a turning radius of about 5.7 meters.Ed's Take:\u000a The safety features on the Rexton include dual airbags, ABS, ESP with hill descent.\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a This segment is one of the most crucial section of any utility vehicle. The car maker has been generous in this regard and bestowed this SUV with quite a few protective aspects for the passengers. There are dual front airbags for enhanced safety of the driver and co-passenger, while the side airbags take care of any collision from either sides of the vehicle. Then there are seatbelts for all the occupants that also has pre-tensioners as well as load limiters, which add to the protective cover. On the outside, it has a triple layer construction with ultra rigid steel, which makes it very strong and muscular.

This is a brand that holds a greatly prominent share of the car market in our country, and has been a major player in this industry for more than three decades now. Most of the machines that the company drives to city roads are meant for utility more than style and glamor, and come with a nominal price tag meant to cater to the common man's needs. The company holds true to its simple and functional design with all of its models, and manages to keep most of them at the top of its audience's list without having to go out of the way with adding style and luxury. Among the great vehicles that the company has set forth is the Omni, a mini van. This is a machine that was originally released by Suzuki under the name of 'Carry'. When originally set out in other countries, it was brought out with a variantly different format. The machine went through numerous revisions and upgrades, and was eventually released in India under the title 'Omni'. This is among the most modest and humbly built Vans in history, yet capable of serving its purpose and keeping the necessities fulfilled within it. The mini van comes with a greatly illustrious history that defies the expectations that were set forth upon it both by conventional thought and by the company. It was taken up by numerous agencies as the primary vehicle. Today, most of the ambulances we see on the roads of our cities are Omnis, helping to bridge the modest needs of common man and to provide service to them through all means. The van is also taken up by numerous other companies and fields of work. It was originally brought out in 1988, and since then, the van has been a large part of the Indian roads.

The power plant has 6 valves integrated together, and delivers a displacement value of 796cc. All of this together yields a greatly formidable performance. Furthermore, it touches a top speed of about 126kmph, and this is also spectacular heart from this modest machine.The interior finish of the vehicle is meant for delight of a different type. The seats and the cabin arena is covered with a good choice of cloth, along with accents of metal and wood for a better overall feel. This is a minivan, and as a result, it has an exalting space within it. Altogether, the cabin of the machine has the capacity to seat 8 adults. It is the perfect buy for large families and for those looking to gather a crowd and head for a road-trip. It is also meant for a good amount of luxury for its passengers whilst seated inside it. Beside its seating, it has ample cargo space at the back for the most loaded good carrying facilities. The rear trunk space issues enormous room for luggage from the passengers. Reclinable front seats provide comfort for the passengers at the front, alongside adjustable front seat head restraints. The driver's seat has a sliding facility, and this brings an extra mile in terms of the pampering that the man behind the wheel is served by the vehicle. A rear view mirror is present on the inside, giving optimum fielded view for the best comfort and safety in one. The floors of the machine have carpets for a cleaner field and vision always. A steering lock provides safety as well as convenience. The vehicle also has compartments for holding spare items, such as a glove compartment with locking facility. The dashboard has a cup holder present within it. Standard seatbelts arm the front and rear seats, with a static facility in the rear seatbelts for added safety. Assist grips exhaust all comfort necessities of the passengers, present at both the front and back. All of this is together wrapped whole with the coolly designed, two tone upholstery that is befitted to the vehicle's inside.Now steering to a more bold outlook, the vehicle is built for a feel of loud menace mingled with soft elegance. The mini van has a most modest build, no larger than a large car. It has a rectangular, clean cut shape that has little sensual appeal imbibed in it, and yet manages to stand out by its own accord. The front is shaped with a slight lean from the windscreen to the bumper. A thin grille is posted below the windscreen, with the headlamps by either side. The emblem of the company is right over the centre of the grille. It rises to the roof in the most crisp and inelegant manner, and runs down towards the rear. The fenders by the side are small and humble, with a more miniature sized wheel for the sides of the vehicle. By the sides of the rear, the headlamps are thin and rectangular, with little stylizing. Body graphics paint additional splendor to the look of the vehicle. A host of other features give the vehicle an enhanced appeal, including a front and rear thermoplastic bumper, a laminated glass windscreen, mud flaps at the front and rear, and clear lens headlamps. The machine has been gifted with a great balance and precision system to go along with its performance. Being a minivan as it is, the Omni needs to strike the right stability to keep itself together with the lanky posture that it takes up. As a result, Maruti leaves nothing unturned in providing the perfect blend of braking and suspension for the benefit of those seated in this vehicle. The calipers arming the brakes at the front and rear are advanced and upto the mark, with discs at the front and drums at the rear. Additional stability is provided with the help of a good suspension system as well. The front axle has McPherson strut, while the rear axle gets a leap spring with shock absorbers for maximum ease when driving. All put together, the Omni is given the benefit of a truly extraordinary stability and balance for the length of its drive. Coming to the last and the most prime instrument of a vehicle's design, the Omni has top notch safety design within it. It is upto-date on all conventional features of safety, and it brings to the fore three point seatbelts and a good body format for optimum impact protection. A 2 speed windshield wiper keeps the screen clean during rain and other rough conditions. All of this put together, this is a machine that guarantees the very best to its passengers, fulfilling its purpose as a machine of function that delivers everything that one needs.

VIntroduction:Mahindra Scorpio has been the undisputed king in the Indian SUV segment for more than a decade now. It changed the fortunes for Mahindra and helped it to become one of largest sports utility machines maker in the country. It is designed and developed indigenously by the manufacturing team of M&M. In its journey in the automobile world, it has won several rewards and awards including "Best SUV of the Year" and "Best Car of the Year" from the popular BBC weekly auto daily "World Wheels". It went through ups and downs in India and faced tough competition from the likes of Tata Safari and Renault Duster and yet survived the challenge. Let's explore further into the vehicle.Pros:1. The New-Gen Scorpio looks intimidating. All thanks to its exterior updates.2. The 2.2-litre mHawk diesel engine delivers exceptional performance.Cons:1. Its ride quality still requires some improvements.2. Price tag of high-end version is very expensive.Standout features:1. . An advanced 6-inch touchscreen infotainment system supports all necessary connectivity features.2. It comes packed with innovative features like static-bending technology, voice assist system, Intellipark and GPS navigation.Overview:Prior to Scorpio, Mahindra had a fleet of basic utility models like Armada, Bolero and others. After the arrival of Scorpio, company's brand image took a turn for good and gained popularity almost instantly. It was the first modern SUV by Mahindra in the country and it certainly lived upto the expectation of the firm and auto enthusiasts across India. At one point, Mahindra Scorpio was the best-selling model in the country. It evolved constantly over the time and entered into a new generation in the year 2014. Recently, the company had to launch this vehicle with an oil-burner with engine capacity of less than 2.0-litre, thanks to the ban on diesel powered vehicles with engine capacity of over 2.0-litres in the national capital. In a bid to further rejuvenate its sales, an automatic version has also been added to its lineup. Now, the Scorpio is available in more than 18 variants with seven and eight seater options.Background and Evolution:In the year 2002, Mahindra introduced its first modern SUV, Scorpio, in the country which changed the perception of a utility vehicle in India. It was an instant success back then that encouraged the company to launch an upgraded version with minor tweaks to its exterior and interior design. While in 2006, its second generation model had been launched with notable changes to its styling and specifications. As the sales experienced a downside, the Indian firm introduced the third-generation Scorpio in 2014 that helped in its revival.Exteriors:Mahindra Scorpio does cast quite the aura, with its well toned body format and menacing demeanour. Powerful lines invigorate its look, while a more masculine build texture adds to the distinguished appeal. We'll admit, we were definitely taken by the Scorpio and its aggressive stature, something that we're sure will lure most viewers from the younger generation.The front end of the Scorpio is not as overdone as some other models of this company, such as the XUV500 or the Xylo. We think that the more down-to-earth, grounded design language that the company has used to shape this model has played to its side. Despite lacking that modern touch that today's vehicles have, the machine does command a unique prowess of its own.At the front, the focus is on the large grille, touched with chrome accents, which is sure to attract the attention of masses.The headlamps come with LED eyebrows, and we thought this added an intriguing touch to the image.At the base of the front skirts, a large air dam stretches out, with fog lamps on both corners. The wide hood is streaked with subtle lines, and the bonnet scoop adds a sporty element to the appearance.Much of the design of its side facet remains the same like its predecessor. The prominent lines that sweep through the sides add some more gravity to the look, along with the clean body cladding.When you take a look at the vehicle's side, you're sure to feel drawn by the muscular wheel arches and the stylish wheel rims beneath them. This latest version now gets 17-inch alloy wheels in its top end variants, while the lower end variants come with steel rims.There is a silver finished bezel highlight on the wheel fenders, and although it's quite subtle, you can tell that the company is willing to go the extra mile to energize this machine's look. For the higher end variants, the door handles and outside mirrors are body coloured, and we loved the unity that this inspired in the look.The tail-gate applique is yet another marvelous touch to the look, while the black number plate applique finishes off the distinctive vision of the vehicle.This latest version of Scorpio measures about 4456mm in length, 1820mm in width (excluding the ORVMs) and stands with a height of 1975mm. It also has a ground clearance of 180mm, which is not suitable for off-roading.Interiors:Interiors of the new generation Scorpio get subtle changes to its design, cosmetics and the quality of materials, bringing an up-market appeal to the cabin. The interior design looks completely different over the predecessor. Be it the dashboard or steering wheel or seating, everything about the interior is new. The cabin is spacious and good enough for seven passengers. But the leg room in second row makes you feel cramped and certainly could have been better.Step inside the vehicle and you'll notice the elegantly designed dashboard that comes in a dual tone scheme. It has a typical SUV design with beige and black colour scheme with metallic highlights.One thing that really caught our eyes is the instrument cluster. It has a bold design featuring two analogue gauges and a digital display. Also, it is packed with a few notification lamps, which helps keep the driver informed.The steering wheel comes with a trendy 4-spoke design, which can also be seen on XUV500. It comes mounted with multi-functional switches for audio control and call functions. All the switches have back-light facility.The center console houses an in-car entertainment system featuring a six inch touchscreen. It is integrated with navigation in 10 different languages. It also offers readouts including tyre pressure and temperature, average fuel consumption, GPS navigation, and other vital stats of the SUV.The front seats of the Scorpio are reasonably comfortable and offer good support thanks to its ergonomic layout. Its high perched positioning is one more reason that makes you feel comfortable.The second row gets knee level air vents console featuring drink holders. It has been positioned well and doesn't eat much of leg room.The third row is furnished with two jump seats. However, higher end variants have an option to choose front facing third row seat with foldable armrest.There are tons of utility features provided inside including accessory power socket, cup holders, glove box, sun visors and a few other storage units.The overall interior design is good, but much more work could have been done to improve the quality.Performance:The new generation Scorpio comes with the same 2.2-litre mHawk diesel engine, but with some minor refinements. Turn the engine on and the SUV roars to life with a slight vibration. It feels smooth and pleasant when on idle. It picks up quite well and you will hardly notice any form of ruggedness. Also, gear shifts feels smooth, thanks to the refined gearbox. This 2179cc engine has the ability to pump out a maximum power of 120bhp at 4000rpm and a hammering torque of 280Nm at 1800 to 2800rpm. For the Delhi and NCR region, Mahindra is offering the Scorpio with a 2.0-litre engine instead of 2.2-litre unit, which has a displacement capacity of 1997cc. This engine produces the same power and torque like its mHawk counterpart. Its acceleration from 0 to 100 kmph is clocked at 14 seconds. Drivability on city roads is good, but Scorpio shows its real performance on highways. Even at speeds of over 100 kmph, it feels relaxed. Transmission duties of this mill are handled by a five speed manual transmission gearbox. The top-spec S10 variant is available with an option to choose a 6-speed automatic transmission gearbox. This SUV has the ability to return a mileage in the range of 13 to 15 kmpl. However, this figure goes down to 13.5 kmpl in its automatic version.Ride and Handling:Its sits on a sturdy suspension system that features hydraulic double acting telescopic shock absorbers. Fitted to the front axle is a double wish-bone suspension layout with independent coil springs, while the rear one is assembled with an anti roll bar loaded multi link coil spring suspension. This gives you a better ride quality unlike any of its nearest rivals. Mahindra is offering this SUV with a conventional disc and drum braking mechanism. However, the presence of anti lock braking system aids its overall performance and lets you enjoy the highway driving to the fullest. The steering on the other hand is very responsive that minimizes the effort required for handling. Parking in tight corners is a one-handed affair.Safety:The all new-generation Scorpio has tons of safety features including digital immobilizer and collapsible steering wheel as standard across all the trims. Currently, the Scorpio is on offer in six trim levels wherein dual front airbags and ABS with EBD are available as standard from S4+ trim onwards. The company is also offering advanced features like auto door locking while driving, seatbelt reminder lamp and parking brake indicator on instrument cluster, while the top-spec S10 trim also comes with speed alert function.Variants:As mentioned above, this third-generation Mahindra Scorpio comes in six variant levels namely, S2, S4, S4+, S6+, S8 and S10. Its base version S2 gets basic set of features including hydraulic power assisted steering, a manual air conditioning unit with heater, power windows with switches on central console, accessory power socket and a few storage units. If you are on a limited budget, then choosing S2 trim would be a wise option, as it would fulfil all your basic requirements. However, if you are a music lover, then you must go with at least S6+, which comes with a 2-DIN audio system featuring a CD player, USB and AUX-In. While the higher-end variant S10 gets advanced features like a 6-inch touchscreen infotainment system, GPS navigation, a driver information system, parking assistant and a voice assistant system.Verdict:The third-generation Mahindra Scorpio has undergone a major overhaul with regards to style, comfort, handling and dynamics. It is perhaps the best option in the entry level SUV segment, thanks to its competitive initial cost of ownership. However, as the trim level increases, it gets painfully pricier. You really have to think twice before going in for the higher-spec model, since it is very expensive for its features, quality and stature. In this segment, you can find Duster as its closest rival, but it is a five seater and its engine size is significantly lower. Hence, Tata Safari Storme is the only alternative for the Scorpio, but it comes with its own drawbacks.

This propels the vehicle to accelerate from 0 to 100 Kmph mark in a mere 8.5 seconds. At the same time, it can go up to a top speed of 195 Kmph.Ed's take: \u000a Considering mind over matter, then the 2.2-litre diesel engine is the most sensible buy as the petrol is expensive and is only available in 3-door.\u000a Under the hood of this Range Rover Evoque, lies a 2.2-litre SD4 oil-burner, which is the same mill that is currently performing in the outgoing model. It has a total of 4-cylinders that have a total of 16 valves in them. It has a displacement capacity of 2179cc. Based on a dual overhead camshaft valve configuration, this mill comes integrated with a turbocharger for a much better power output. It can churn out a maximum of 187.7bhp at 5200rpm in combination with a commanding torque output of 420Nm at 2000rpm. This drive train been mated to an advanced nine speed automatic transmission gearbox that distributes the engine power to all its four wheels. This sophisticated gearbox not just improves the performance, but it also reduces the fuel consumption by 20%.Ed''s take: \u000a The diesel engine of the Evoque is frugal despite having good performance. And now it has improved further as it is offered with a nine-speed ZF transmission.\u000a Currently, this new generation Evoque draws power from the same SD4 oil-burner sourced from Ford Motors. This mill has the common rail direct fuel injection technology helping it to deliver a mileage of approximately 12.7 Kmpl, under standard driving conditions.Ed's take: \u000a The Evoque gets the smallest engine from the JLR stable, which is the new 2.0-litre petrol. But the power rating of these engines is good.\u000a The 2.2-litre diesel engine is a 4-cylindered mill built with technology based on a DOHC valve configuration. It is also turbocharged for enhanced power output. This drive-train is capable of unleashing a peak power of 187.7bhp along with a torque of 420Nm.Ed's take: \u000a Being a luxury vehicle, the Evoque gets touchscreen music system, cruise control, ESP, premium leather.\u000a The manufacturer is currently offering all the trims with an advanced touchscreen infotainment system having an 8-inch high resolution display. It is integrated with a Land Rover Sound System and has a total of 8 speakers with 'InControl Touch'. Also include is a 5-inch TFT color driver information center that displays crucial information and keeps the driver informed. Besides this, there are connectivity features like USB, AUX-In and Bluetooth. The HSE trim also has an Autostrasse (Asia Nav) navigation system along with a 380W Meridian sound system as standard feature. In addition to these, we can also find a Head-up display that adds to the convenience of driver.Ed's take: \u000a The ride and handling characteristics of the Evoque are good, as the ride is plush like any Range Rover and the handling is just like a sedan\u000a This SUV has a reliable braking and suspension mechanism like we have seen in other Land Rover models. All its wheels are fitted with disc brakes featuring high performance calipers. Aiding this mechanism are the anti-lock braking system, electronic brake force distribution and emergency brake assist system that offers driver with superior control over the SUV. It also features cornering brake control, dynamic and roll stability control, electric parking brake and trailer stability assist function. On the other hand, the front and rear axles are assembled with an adaptive dynamic system that helps in reducing the impact of jerks and provide an exceptional driving experience. It is also integrated a highly responsive power steering system that makes it quite simpler to handle this SUV.Ed's take: \u000a The safety features list on the Evoque is fairly long, just like most of the luxury vehicles in this segment. It has the Active Driveline as optional package that also improves the handling.\u000a There is no doubt that the JLR has put-on its hard work to ensure highest level of protection to the occupants. It has built this SUV with a rigid body structure integrating it with impact beams and crumple zones. This enhances safety of the occupants in case of any crash and minimizes the risk of injury. As for the features, much of them have been retained from the outgoing model. It has an advanced engine immobilizer with security alarm system that safeguards the vehicle from theft and any unauthorized entry. The company has also given innovative aspects like terrain response system along with torque vectoring by braking, which will reduce the efforts of the driver, while improving the performance.

VFord Mustang\u000a has always been the iconic car of America and will be so in the future. This pony car was first launched in the year 1965 and it has never looked back ever since. It has passed through decades and now it is in its sixth generation with an all new look, performance and features. However, the exciting part is that the manufacturer is considering the feasibility of launching this iconic car for the Indian automobile enthusiasts. There is no confirmed information yet relating to this vehicle but, there are many experts, who believe that this super car is going to be launched in the country's emerging car bazaar. The manufacturer has already started testing the right-hand drive version of this vehicle, which adds fuel to the speculations of its launch in the country. Currently, the manufacturer is offering the 2015 version of Mustang in a few markets across the globe and the same version is expected in India as well. Unlike its predecessor, this latest version looks quite stunning with more aggressive cues on its front facade. As you can see in the images, the headlight cluster has an extremely sleek structure with black finish and is housed with projector headlamps. The finish on bonnet too gets some improvement with flawless lines that adds to its masculine stance. However, the most attractive aspect of this vehicle will remain to be its radiator grille that is embodied with iconic brand's logo. As far as interiors are concerned, this vehicle has a classy internal cabin that is done up with all black color scheme. However, buyers have the option to personalize its cabin with a color scheme of their own choice.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis two door version is made to accommodate at least four occupants with two individual front seats and a rear bench seat. Unlike in the overseas markets, in India, it might be introduced with several safety and comfort features as standard. One can expect for standard comfort features like electronic temperature control, Mustang Dashboard, an advanced infotainment system with SYNC 2 connectivity feature. In terms of safety, features like powerful braking system, airbags and anti-theft protection package are most likely to be fitted in this vehicle. In the European markets, it is currently available in two variants. It is most likely that the manufacturer will introduce these two variants in India considering feasibility of shipping and customer demand. Among those, its entry level trim is powered by a high performance 2.3-litre EcoBoost engine, whereas the top end trim is powered by a V8, EcoBoost petrol motor. However, it is highly unlikely that the vehicle will be introduced as a CKD version, since it requires special manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure to meet the quality norms. At the same time, one can expect for the same on-road capabilities and driving dynamics like it has in the European markets. But right now, it is too early to say anything related to this vehicle as the manufacturer has not confirmed anything related to its launch.It is most likely that the manufacturer might introduce the recently unveiled 2015 version of Ford Mustang in India, which looks much aggressive than its earlier version. If this is the case, then auto enthusiasts in the country will be getting more than what they have expected for. This latest version carry forwards the iconic design language of the company that inspired many designers across the segment. It has the trademark radiator grille featuring a black colored perforated mesh, which is embedded with the model's badge. However, its headlight cluster of this latest version gone sleeker with clear lens design and black tinted finish inside. It is further housed with an elegant lighting pattern featuring projector headlamps along with turn indicators. The front bumper is rugged as usual with improved design featuring a black colored bumper lip. It houses a pair of fog lamps that further enhances the visibility in foggy condition. Coming to the side facet, this vehicle has a sleek profile with well carved fenders and expressively sculptured shoulder lines. Its wheel arches are going to be fitted with alloy wheels, but it is too early to specify the size of those rims. This two door version also has sleek window frames with black finish, while the door handles and ORVM caps are done up in body color. The rear facet is another attractive aspect of this pony car, thanks to the elegant taillight design and high gloss black accents on its tailgate. Unlike the front bumper, its rear one is extremely large, which is housed with a license plate console along with a pair of reflectors and other add-ons. It is also fitted with a body colored lower cladding along with a pair of black tinted exhaust pipes.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aExterior Measurements:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aConsidering the fact that the company may launch it as a CKD version, we can expect it to have the same exterior dimensions like its international version. If so, it is going to have a total length of 188.3 inches along with a decent width of 81.9 inches (excluding outside mirrors) and a decent height of just about 54.4 inches.There is no doubt that this yet to be launched Ford Mustang has one of the classy interior design with flawless design down to the closest detail. Its cabin is made using a lot of leather upholstery that is highlighted by metallic accents. The design of the interiors are precisely sculptured for those who prefers luxuriant finish inside the cabin. At the same time, there is an ample space available inside this vehicle, especially in the cockpit section. However, the rear compartment has slightly lesser leg and head space, but is comfortable enough for two occupants. All the seats inside are covered with premium leather upholstery, which the customers can choose it with contrast stitching. Both the front seats are separated by a massive floor console, which is housed with cup holders along with a gearshift box. The center fascia is equipped with an advanced infotainment system along with an AC unit and various illuminated control switches. There is a lot of chrome used inside the cabin, especially to the dial type switches, cup holders and inside door handles. Its dashboard is something that represents the unique identity of Mustang, as it has a layered design with masculine build. The instrument cluster is quite large has a rectangular design featuring two round shaped meters and a full color display. It notifies the driver with all the important information related to this vehicle.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInterior Comfort:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aComing to the interior comforts, there is no information from the company or from the experts regarding what kind of features this vehicle will have on-board. It is most likely that the manufacturer will launch it in two trim levels or else in only one trim, which should not be a surprise to the auto enthusiasts. However, considering its stature and price range, we can expect for several advanced features like those in its international version. Individuals can expect for some of the standard features like an automatic air conditioning system, a power assisted steering with tilt along with telescopic adjustment, electrically operated outside mirrors, automatic headlamps and parking assistance program. At the same time, we can also expect for electrically adjustable front seats including lumbar support and memory function that further adds to the traveling comfort.

Its international version also has a total of 13.5 cubic feet of trunk space along with a massive fuel tank that can store up to 13 gallons. In India, its trunk volume is expected to be the same like above, but we can expect that the fuel tank capacity can be much lower.The variant, which is powered by a 2.3-litre EcoBoost engine is expected to come with both six speed manual and automatic transmission gearbox, which allow the vehicle to reach a top speed of 240 Kmph. In the mean time, one can expect it to break the 100 Kmph speed mark from a standstill in approximately 5 seconds. On the other hand, its V8 mill too is expected to come with both manual and automatic gear box option. With this engine, the Ford Mustang can reach an electronically regulated top speed of 250 Kmph, while breaking the 100 Kmph mark in 4 seconds.Coming to the engine specifications, this yet to be launched version is speculated to arrive with two different EcoBoost engine options for the auto enthusiasts to choose from. One of the variant is expected to be fitted with a highly acclaimed 2.3-litre petrol engine that is integrated with an advanced direct fuel injection system. It comprises of 4-cylinders and 16-valves based on conventional DOHC valve configuration. It is capable of producing a superior power of 310hp that yields in a peak torque output of 434Nm. On the other hand, it is also expected to arrive with a 5.0-litre EcoBoost engine, which is also based on the same valve configuration like other motor. However, it comprises of 8 cylinders and 32-valves and is integrated with a turbocharger. This power plant is capable of producing a peak power of 415hp along with a hammering torque output of 524Nm. Both these power plants are expected to be mated with six speed manual transmission gearbox as standard. At the same time, the manufacturer may also offer six speed automatic gearbox as an optional feature. In addition to these, it is also expected to host features like an Eco start/stop function, which will help to improve the efficiency of these motors.It is most likely to be launched in two variants with two different petrol engine options like mentioned earlier. One of its version is expected to host a 2.3-litre EcoBoost engine that is integrated with a direct fuel injection technology. This mill may have the ability to deliver a maximum mileage of 14 Kmpl. On the other hand, its another variant is speculated to host a 5.0-litre V8 engine, which is also incorporated with a direct fuel injection system. This mill is expected to deliver a peak mileage of approximately 9 Kmpl on highways.Its revolutionary 2.3-litre EcoBoost engine that is integrated with a turbo charging unit. This power plant has the ability to churn out a maximum power of 310bhp along with a pounding torque of 434Nm. On the other hand, its 5.0-litre mill comprises of eight cylinders and 32-valves based on twin independent camshaft timing. This mill has the ability to pump out a peak power of 415bhp and a mammoth torque output of 524Nm, which is impressive.This upcoming vehicle is expected to host a series of advanced equipments that will ensure a fascinating traveling experience. We can expect it to host a proficient infotainment system featuring a high resolution color display along with eight loud speakers system. In addition to these, they might host a DVD player along with an FM radio and a high end surround sound system, which delivers high quality sound output. At the same time, it can also support video playback along with navigation system, which further adds to the customer excitement. On the other hand, this vehicle is blessed with an array of styling features, which completes this vehicle according to the customers needs. Hence, there wont be any requirement for the buyers to personalize its exteriors or interiors with several other styling aspects.Like any other high end pony car, this vehicle too expected to come with a highly efficient braking mechanism, which is loaded with internally vented disc brakes and superior brake calipers. At the same time, it can be integrated with ABS and EBD for superior stopping power. At the same time, we can expect for advanced electronic stability program and other traction control functions, which further augments its overall on-road performance. On the other hand, it will also come with a carefully tuned suspension system McPherson strut system at front and multi-link independent suspension at rear. This will ensure outstanding ride comfort and superior handling dynamics like no other.Like any other high end pony car, this vehicle too expected to come with a highly efficient braking mechanism, which is loaded with internally vented disc brakes and superior brake calipers.

Talking about Fiat India, it has displayed few of the upcoming models including the Fiat Linea 125s. It is nothing but a more powerful version of existing Linea, which is powered by a 1.4-litre T-Jet petrol engine. This motor, unlike in regular petrol versions, produces a maximum power of 123bhp along with a peak torque of 210Nm. As for the transmission, it is most likely to be mated with a 5-speed manual gearbox. As per the sources, this performance version is expected soon in the second half of this year, or may be during the upcoming festive season.Exteriors:In the year 2014, this sedan has undergone extensive makeover to its styling, especially on its outside. The previous year, its limited edition variant has been introduced with an accessory package featuring some sporty cosmetics. However, it didn't save Linea from experiencing a downfall in its sales. Now, at the Delhi Auto Expo 2016, the automaker has displayed its performance version, christened as Linea 125S. It is essentially the existing version of Linea, but with few upgrades to its engine and with some minor changes to its styling.This soon to be launched vehicle features exclusive cosmetics such as blackened roof, outside mirrors and alloy wheels. We can also see exclusive badging of the variant on its boot-lid.Moving on with the existing version of Linea, it looks more like a budget car. Although it received facelift in 2014, the Linea failed to garner attention, thanks to its sobered front facia.Its headlight cluster bears a dual barrel design featuring conventional lamps. The manufacturer should have offered projector headlamps instead of dual parabola headlamps. Most other rivals of Linea including the likes of Ciaz and Verna come with projector headlamps.The redesigned radiator grille has dated design with extensive chrome treatment to its surround strip. There are two horizontal strips in it garnished with glossy black. The company's emblem is positioned in the center of grille.Its front bumper is the only thing that could attract you. It looks drastically different from its predecessor and has bigger air vents and a premium design rendering a class look to the car. Unlike other sedans, there is an extensive use of chrome that adds to the sophistication.The side profile of the car has a similar design to that of its predecessor or perhaps, it looks precisely the same as its earlier version. Even the design of alloy wheels remains the same. Its base and mid-range variants get 15-inch steel rims, while the range topper Emotion gets 16-inch alloy wheels.As we all know, Fiat has displayed the performance version of its family sedan, the Linea 125s at the Auto Expo 2016. This car is seen with black alloy wheels and red disc brake calipers exuding the sense of sportiness.The rear profile of the car has a contemporary look like every other C segment sedan. We can see a great amount of chrome on the boot-lid and bumper as well. The taillight cluster too has chrome underlining that makes for a rich appeal.This contemporary sedan measures 4596mm in length, 1730mm in its width and stands at a height of 1487mm. It also has a long wheelbase of 2603mm, but Ciaz has the longest wheelbase in this class with 2650mm.Linea is more like a classy looking sedan without much of modern design traits. However, its build quality, fit and finish is something better than other conventional sedans of today.Interiors:The 2014 version of Linea received a significant makeover to its interior design exceeding all the expectations of average auto lovers. Its cabin is spacious, well designed and equally well arranged over its predecessor. This sedan has class leading cabin space and ergonomic seating arrangement, making for a comfortable travelling experiencing. Also, it is loaded with good package of features ensuring convenient and comfortable drive. Company's recent introduction at the auto show Linea 125s also features the same design like its existing variants. However, it features a few additional equipments including an infotainment system.Step inside the vehicle and you'll notice the dual tone dashboard. The colour scheme looks bright unlike other sedans. The fit and finish inside the car is far better and it will surely surprise you. However, the design still lacks that modern touch.The central console of dashboard gets some glossy black inserts rendering an upmarket look to the cabin. These inserts are seen around the infotainment system and the AC vents.The instrument cluster has a twin-pod design with sporty dials. It features four analogue gauges along with a digital display aiding driver to receive all the vital information related to the car. Also, it features a few warning lights.The 2014 Linea gets a conventional 3-spoke, yet a stylish steering wheel that feels premium. It features multi-functional switches, which feels smooth and easy to operate. The company is offering the range-topper Emotion trim with leather upholstery.The most important thing for any sedan is its seating arrangement and this Linea lives up to our expectations by offering good support and comfort. The seating design is based on sound ergonomics, while its side bolsters aid in offering better support to the body.The rear bench seat also has an ergonomic design. But, we really felt surprised with the rear seating, thanks to the excellent thigh support and greater leg space. Here, you also get a center armrest with cup holders and a storage tray as well.This car is loaded with all important equipments and features. Its central console houses an integrated music system featuring a CD player and few other connectivity ports, while the high end version also gets a CD player and an automatic climate control unit. It is unfortunate that the car didn't get a touch screen infotainment system. However, this feature is on offer for the recently launched Elegante edition. This limited edition trim features a 6.5-inch multifunctional touch screen infotainment system along with a CD/MP3 player and radio with AM/FM tuner. Besides USB and AUX-In connectivity ports, it also supports Blue&Me hands free system.This car has a boot space capacity of about 500-litres, and we can expand it further by folding the rear bench seat.This 2014 Linea is unquestionably the spacious sedan in its class and far more comfortable than its nearest rivals. But the cabin design lacks that sheer modern look like those in the Ciaz and Honda CityPerformance:The existing version of Linea comes with two engine options including the 1.4-litre T-Jet petrol motor and a 1.3-litre Multijet diesel engine.Petrol engine:The 1.4-litre T-Jet petrol motor is known for its sheer performance. With a power output of 112.4bhp, it outperforms every single car in its class. Ignite the engine and youâ\u20ac\u2122ll feel its power right away. You'll find it hard to stop yourself from revving it up at idle. Such is the efficiency of T-Jet petrol motor. Pick-up and acceleration of this version is simply outstanding. Its high torque output at low rpms makes city driving even more exciting. But the real fun comes only on highways and it can easily go beyond 160 kmph mark. Even at a speed of 110 kmph, the engine feels relaxed and ready to go even further. The transmission duty of this engine is handled by a 5-speed manual gearbox that offers smooth shifting of gears. The other one is a Fire petrol engine that also comes with same displacement capacity and configuration like its T-Jet counterpart. However, it churns out less power of 88.8bhp at 6000rpm and the torque of 115Nm at 4500rpm, which is drastically lower than T-Jet mill. On the other hand, the recently unveiled Linea 125s trim is said to be more powerful with an output of 123bhp and a torque of 210Nm.Diesel Engine:The diesel version of Linea gets a critically acclaimed and most awarded 1248cc oil-burner. This motor has been the game changer for Fiat, especially in the country like India. It is powerful, efficient and reliable, as compared to any other motor in its class. Driving the Linea with this 1.3-Multijet under the hood feels absolute fun. Its power deliver remains linear and the response of engine is amazing. Its drivability on city roads is so simple, thanks to the low end torque. This motor can pump out a maximum power of 91.7bhp at 4000rpm and a maximum torque of 209Nm at just 2000rpm. However, its mileage is a big letdown, since it returns only about 20.4 kmpl.Ride and Handling:All the variants except T-Jet versions come with disc and drum braking mechanism, while the T-Jet variants are loaded with disc brakes for all four wheels. Adding to this, the anti lock braking system and electronic brake-force distribution makes driving for more predictable. This ABS feature is available as standard for Dynamic, Emotion and all T-Jet variants. The Linea gets a superior suspension system as well. This car's front axle has an independent wheel type of layout and the rear one gets a torsion beam type of mechanism. Both these axles are further loaded with helical coil springs along with double acting telescopic dampers and stabilizer bars that enables it to deal with all the irregularities on the roads. Not but the least, this sedan gets a highly responsive power steering system that makes for a predictable handling.Safety:Safety standards of this sedan are at par with other best-selling sedans. Thatâ\u20ac\u2122s because of its sturdy build quality and features it has. Even the base versions in the line-up gets automatic door locking facility, fire prevention system and an engine immobilizer with rolling code. Also, they have features like double crank prevention system and central door locking. The mid range and the top-spec variants get all-four disc braking mechanism as standard (T-Jet petrol version only). In addition to these, they also have dual stage driver airbag with early crash sensor and a front passenger airbag as well.Variants:This current version of Linea comes in three trim levels namely Active, Dynamic and Emotion. 'Active' is the entry level variant featuring all standard and essential features ob-board. This base variant comes packed with a manual HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) unit along with foot level AC vents for rear passengers seat as well. This variant also comes with few other features including electrically adjustable outside mirrors, interior roof light with dimming effect, rear defogger with timer, power windows, remote keyless entry and most importantly, an integrated music player with 4 speakers. If you are a budget conscious person, then going for this base variant would save a lot of money.The next-in-line Dynamic variant has few additional features including an automatic climate control unit, driver seat height adjuster, reverse parking sensors, an audio system with Blue&Me feature, 6 speakers, USB/AUX-In connectivity and a multi-functional steering wheel.The high-end 'Emotion' variant on the other hand gets sophisticated features including a cruise control unit, ambient lighting on dashboard, premium leather seating upholstery and 16-inch alloy wheels.Verdict:In our opinion, Fiat Linea is a decent car to go with. Despite of a few shortcomings, it has enough features that offer a great value for money. Besides, its performance is simply the best in its class. Its cabin is spacious and far more comfortable in the C-segment. However, it lacks the styling of a modern car, which is unfortunate. If you are a budget-conscious person and looking for a reliable and a durable car in the segment, then Linea is the one for you.

VThe Mercedes-Benz SLC is the successor to the SLK two-door. Revealed in 2015, the SLC is offered with a range of petrol and diesel engines, but Mercedes-Benz India will start right at the top, by launching the AMG SLC43. The roadster is the first AMG model to have the \u201843\u2019 label in its name and while the design is essentially a facelift of the SLK, there\u2019s more than meets the eye.The primary change is the SLC\u2019s new engine. In keeping with the era of downsizing, the model gets a 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 that replaces the naturally aspirated V8 that was used in the SLK. The new motor produces 367PS of power and a peak torque of 520Nm, all of which, is sent to the rear wheels. 0-100kmph comes up in a claimed 4.7 seconds, with the top speed rated at 250kmph (electronically-limited). The SLC43 comes with a 9-speed automatic gearbox as standard and the transmission gets paddle shifters as well.For improved handling and stability, the SLC43 gets a steel suspension that has been optimised to reduce body roll and you also get the AMG \u2018Dynamic Select\u2019 function, which enables the driver to alter the suspension\u2019s behavior, based on the driving scenario. Additionally, you can opt for a \u2018handling package\u2019, which gives you a mechanical limited-slip differential for the rear axle.The SLC43 is a thing of beauty with the compact proportions complementing the car\u2019s understated styling. Highlights on the exterior include a new front bumper with large air intakes, a muscular bonnet, 18-inch alloy wheels and a new rear bumper with integrated tailpipes.On the inside, the car features a multifunction, flat-bottomed steering wheel draped in nappa leather, with red contrast stitching for a premium ambience. The sports seats get AMG nappa leather/Dinamica microfibre upholstery and in the driver\u2019s line-of-vision is an AMG instrument cluster that includes a 4.5-inch multi-information display (MID) with a race-timer provided as well. For entertainment, the car is offered with a 7-inch infotainment system that supports Bluetooth connectivity, a DVD player, Internet radio and the \u2018Linguatronic\u2019 voice command system.The SLC has quite a legacy to live up to. The SLK nameplate was introduced in 1996, and since its introduction, it scored a sales tally of 6.7 lakh units worldwide. With the SLC43, though, Mercedes-Benz India will cater to a very niche audience and while it won\u2019t rock the sales charts, it will offer a stylish, compact and agile rival to models like the Audi TT and BMW Z4.

VFerrari 458 Speciale, the most extreme road-legal from Ferrari has been unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show September this year. If we watch it from a naked eye, it appears nothing more than a regular 458 but the content hidden underneath says the whole story making this supercar truly worthy of the \u201cSpeciale\u201d insignia. The new model from Ferrari is innovation to new active aerodynamic and traction modification technologies to make it the fastest and capable Ferrari roadster to grace a track. It sports very interesting specs under the hood retaining the same but slightly tuned 4.5L V-8 powertrain from the base 458 Italia. It generates massive power of 596hp and 540Nm of torque. However the torque value remains the same as in the base 458, its horsepower has been increased by 34hp. Ferrari has been claiming this as the highest figure ever achieved by a naturally aspirated road car engine which edges it closer to its opponent McLaren 12c (616bhp). The engine is coupled with a seven-speed F1 dual clutch paddle-shift transmission gearbox. This great combination allows this beast to achieve 100kmph in mere 3 seconds of time reaching the top speed of 325kmph which Ferrari claims the highest lateral acceleration in any of its roadsters. This supercar also features a new Side Slip Angle Control System that instantly senses oversteering and automatically manages torque delivery and distribution via Formula 1-Trac traction control and E-Diff electronic differential. The advance combination of tailored Michelin Pilot Sport Cup2 tyres helps in improving balance and traction. The braking system has also been upgraded with the introduction of new calipers inspired from LaFerrari. Not only this, Ferrari 458 Speciale also shows its improved emission ratings with 275g CO2/km against 307g CO2/km in 458 coupe. The first and foremost thing that to be noticed in this cranked-up 458 Speciale is its graceful red paint job and combination of blue and white stripes lying on it giving it a stunning look. Front fascia of the car has been given much treatment with more sculptured bonnet giving more room for ventilation. It now features a reverse-vented hood which permits free air flow and help reduce drag. Rear has striking similarity to the racecar with larger diffuser and dual integrated exhaust pipes replacing the standard 458\u2019s trio tailpipes. Ferrari in its latest offering has installed a heavily tailored front skirt which it has named \u201cmoveable aerodynamics\u201d that increases downforce and help in lower dragging. As per other aerodynamic enhancing mods, they can be seen easily seen as on the outer edges of the front clothing, a wide opening and reverse-vented hood. In addition to this, Ferrari also reduced this supercar\u2019s weight to 1290kg from stock weight of 1380kg. The interiors of the car follow the architecture of Italia with a few elegant and purposeful modifications. Sabelt racer seats are affixed featuring standard carbon-fiber shells with presence of Alcantara. The glovebox and carpets have been omitted. The steering wheel inside are perfectly carved holding loads of buttons without any ordinary audio and cruise controlling functions. The lower right of the car, there is housed in a carbon fiber insert, the red Manetinno commutator switch that controls all five performance settings.

VIntroduction:Toyota comes with an illustrious history, and we know for one that this company holds sway over a massive base here in India. The Toyota Prius is just the type of vehicle that the company gets its audience to prey on. Slick design, strong comfort and an overall pleasing drive experience make this vehicle a model to remember. Nevertheless, the Prius does lose out on some other facets, and we're here to cut the balance between the two of them for you.Pros:1. Astounding looks, and we've got to say, very few vehicles can come up with a theme so unique.2. The handling is neutral, and we're sure all type of drivers can easily adapt to it.Cons:1. The legroom at the rear could disappoint people.2. Most people of the day expect a Touchscreen Infotainment system, and the absence of it does let the appeal slip.Stand-out Features:1. It comes with a slew of techno systems, including ABS, EBD and many others, and this is sure to ease the ride experience.Overall:The Prius strikes as a one of a kind experience, with modern design that is mixed with some never seen before features. At the exterior facet, the model invokes a sporty appearance, with a graceful body format that is sure to get heads turning. Aside from this, the interior has been lavished with a serene environment that comes along with many comfort facilities, ranging from the air conditioning and power windows to the audio system. The machine is driven by a 1.8-litre petrol engine that enables decent performance as well as mileage.Exteriors:We enjoyed the Prius\u2019s unique and classy design, and we're sure that it would have great appeal for the younger generation. It takes a low and streamlined stance, and when you can have a glimpse of some fine design elements here and there, you feel a more wholesome image put together. The skin texture is flawless and attractive, and the soothing curvatures add delight to the visual field.Starting off at the front, the thin grille strapped over the face makes for some delicate touches. The emblem of the company is posted at the centre, making for a more distinguished air. The sharp headlamps flow into the side profile, and we thought this added some a grittier look to the vehicle.When you take a look at the intricate detailing of the headlamps, you're sure to appreciate the company's bold design and strong safety elements.At the bottom of the front skirt, the large air dam harmonises the front look, adding to the sporty demeanour. The fog lamps rest by the corner of the skirts, and we thought they integrated into the image perfectly. One has to admire the manner in which the bonnet slides down gently from the windscreen, giving the vehicle's image a more aesthetic flavour that we're sure most people would love.The skin of the hood wraps sideways over the wheel arches, adding a more masculine feel to the area. The well designed wheels project a mix of sportiness and plush, and we thought they were a great element of the side body.The serene lines that glide over the door-sides bring a more enriched effect to the look. Meanwhile, the body coloured door handles and mirrors blend into the picture well, bringing forward the refined fabric of the design.When you stand before the vehicle, you're sure to feel a mark of perfection in the balanced, slender shape. The roof-line takes off from the bulkier region of the rear, flowing over the cabin gently, before slotting right into the bonnet with utmost precision.The black effect of the window frames looked great in our opinion, adding some diversity to the image. At the rear, the tail-lamps streak upwards by the corners of the rear, and a large black garnish that spreads over the region invites some true glamour into the vehicle.Interiors\u000a:The cabin of the Toyota Prius is moderately spacious, and there are some noticeable, fine themes that bring a more resplendent feel to the place. In addition to this, the cabin is blanketed by this air of pure sophistication that we thought was dazzling.Aside from this, legroom was plentiful in the front row, but the same for the rear could have been improved slightly. Room for shoulder is also plenty, and most of our team found little to complain about during the drive. Aside from the roominess, the cabin has a silky touch that passengers would surely enjoy, and with the coupled benefit of a many exciting comfort features, the ride is nearly impeccable. The dashboard stretches downwards towards the leg-region of the vehicle, giving a better fashioned look to the front.At the centre of the dash is an advanced looking music system that comes with the display screen at the top and the buttons stacked below.The centre console streams down and melds into the front armrest, and this latches a marvellous tone into the entire look. The steering wheel at the side has been conditioned with the same, sporty design that most vehicles of the day wear, and we personally thought it was amazing.The centre of the wheel has been beefed up, giving a more distinctive look to the place. The silver elements on the wheel further rejuvenate the image, while the Toyota emblem at the centre of the wheel wraps off the look. Coming to the seating and comfort, one has to agree that rich upholstery, together with headrests, armrests and adjustable facilities would leave just about flattered.Performance:Powering the vehicle is a 1.8-litre engine that features various systems such as a cooled EGR system, electric water pump, along with a variable valve timing feature. It is composed of four cylinders and sixteen valves put together through the double overhead camshaft arrangement. A displacement of 1798cc is decent in our opinion, although there are many in the models' rivalling factions that have done much better. This machine has a power of 97.8bhp and torque stands at 142Nm. A crucial element of the engine is the hybrid synergy drive, which enables it to optimise fuel efficiency, while at the same time, keeping the drive smooth and flawless.Ride and Handling:Strong disc brakes clamp down on the front as well as the rear, and we thought that the overall braking quality was superb. Cornering is easy, and slowing down and halting requires little strain. There is no body roll, but high speed does shake up the inside a bit. Coming to the suspension system, there is a McPherson strut armed onto the front axle. We thought that the overall ride was comfortable enough, but conditions could defer depending on the road terrain. The vehicle absorbs moderate road anomalies well, and we thought an average Indian passenger would feel quite satisfied with the overall comfort.Safety:We were quite satisfied with the safety parameters enforced by the company. Advanced techno aids cement control, and this includes conventional facilities including Anti lock braking system and the Electronic brake-force distribution system. The two of these together help to regulate control when driving, and this eases the ride while at the same time, boosting safety. Next, there is vehicle stability and traction control systems as well, helping to insulate the vehicle from anomalies. A strong airbag system shields all of the occupants, and this includes dual front airbags, side airbags, curtain and knee airbags as well. Further strengthening this is a supplement restraint system, which ascertains a higher level of safety. The body has been given a well toned structure, with crumple zones at the front and rear that minimise damage during a mishap.Variants:There are two variants in the model series, Z5 and Z6, and the differences between them are negligible. Both of them come along with many beneficial elements, including an automatic climate control system, rear parking sensors, power windows for the front and rear, cup holders at the front and rear, cruise control and many more, automatic headlamps and many more.Verdict:We'll give it to this Japanese major, for they know exactly what gets the market going here in India. Toyota Prius has got the style, the looks, the comforts and a mediocre performance as well. It has genuine themes in its architecture that you're probably never going to see elsewhere in a vehicle. Nevertheless, there are things that could put people off as well, and this includes the lack of space within the cabin, the less than average mileage and the lack of personalisation schemes. At the end of the day, the machine comes with its bag of pros to woo you, and some let downs as well, and it's best if you approach this model with a simple state of mind without too much to expect.

About 251 litres of massive boot space is available which is advantageous in undertaking long journeys.Ed's Take:\u000a The acceleration of the Etios Cross is good and it is thanks to the power-to-weight that despite lower power ratings, it has good acceleration.\u000a Both diesel and petrol motors with an advanced five speed manual transmission gearbox. Its 1.4-litre mill, which helps the vehicle to attain a top speed of around 160 to 165 kmph. Meanwhile, it can accelerate from 0 to 100 Kmph mark in close to 18 seconds, which is quite good. Its 1.5-litre petrol motor allows the vehicle to reach the 100 Kmph speed barrier in the range of approximately 11 to 12 seconds. At the same time, it enables the vehicle to reach a maximum speed of about 150 to 160 Kmph. While the 1.2-litre mill is also perkier, as it can zoom towards the 100 Kmph speed mark from a standstill in just 14 seconds. This engine helps the vehicle to achieve a top speed of about 145 to 150 Kmph, which is quite good.Ed's Take:\u000a Both the engines on the Etios Cross are good enough and you can pick up of the two, depending on your running. This is one department that you do not have to worry about.\u000a This model series is offered with two petrol and one diesel engine options. The diesel variants are incorporated with a 1.4-litre, D-4D engine that can displace 1364cc. It carries four cylinders that are further fitted with eight valves are based on a single overhead camshaft valve configuration and has common rail fuel injection system. The maximum power produced by this motor is 67.06bhp at 3800rpm and can generate a peak torque output of 170Nm in the range of 1800 to 2400rpm. It has a 1.2-litre petrol mill that comes with the total displacement capacity of 1197cc. This carries four cylinders, which are integrated with 16 valves. This can produce a peak power of 78.9bhp at 5600rpm along with a maximum torque output of 104Nm at 3100rpm. A few trims are also equipped with a 1.5-litre, petrol power plant that is capable of displacing 1496cc. This has the ability to generate a maximum power of 88.76bhp at 5600rpm. At the same time, yields a hammering torque output of 132Nm at 3000rpm, which is rather good. Both these motors are based on a double overhead camshaft valve configuration and integrated with an electronic fuel injection system. All the three engines are skillfully paired with a five speed manual transmission gearbox, which distributes torque output to its front wheels.Ed's Take:\u000a The light body weight of the Etios and the Etios Liva helps to make them highly efficient vehicles. The Etios Cross too, is based on the same platform. The diesel can stunt you with its fuel efficiency figures.\u000a Both petrol engines have been incorporated with an electronic fuel injection system. Its 1.2-litre petrol mill has the ability to give away a maximum mileage of 17.71 kmpl on highways and a minimum of 13.29 kmpl on city roads. While the 1.5-litre petrol mill can produce a minimum mileage of approximately 12.04 kmpl in peak traffic conditions, but gives way a maximum mileage of 16.78 Kmpl on expressways. Its D-4D diesel engine is incorporated with an advanced common rail fuel injection technology. This power plant has the ability to produce a maximum mileage of 23.59 kmpl on city roads, which goes down to a minimum of 18.04 Kmpl on highways.Ed's Take:\u000a The power produced by the petrol and diesel versions of the Etios Cross is decent, but the drivability is phenomenal. Especially of the 1.5-litre petrol.\u000a Its diesel engine is based on single overhead camshaft valve configuration with 4-cylinders and 8-valves. This mill can unleash a power of 67.06bhp and a pounding torque output of 170Nm, which is quite good. Both the petrol engines in this series are based on a DOHC valve configuration with 4-cylinders and 16-valves. Its 1.2-litre mill has the ability to produce a maximum power of 78.9bhp along with a peak torque output of 104Nm. While its 1.5-litre mill has the ability to pump out a maximum power of 88.76bhp and a hammering torque output of 132Nm.Ed's Take:\u000a The Etios Cross gets features like in-built music system, steering mounted audio controls and alloy wheels. The wheels on the Cross are 15-inch from the Etios sedan, and hence the ground clearance of the Etios Cross has been increased by 4 mm.\u000a A 2-DIN music system which can be controlled by a remote is present. This can support a CD, MP3, AM/FM and a USB which is complimented by four speakers. Additionally, high end variants are blessed with Aux-in and Bluetooth connectivity as well. The audio controls are mounted onto the steering wheel. Apart from these, the user can further customize the vehicle with many other accessories at an additional cost from an authorized dealer.Ed's Take:\u000a The ride on the Etios Cross is well sorted at low speeds. It glides over potholes with a muted thud. The handling is better on the Liva as it has a shorter wheelbase, but it does get a bit jittery and unsettled at higher speeds.\u000a When it comes to suspension, its front axle has a McPherson strut whereas the rear axle is fitted with a torsion beam. Its braking mechanism consists of a set of efficient ventilated disc brakes. While its rear wheels have a standard set of drum brakes. An anti lock braking system is coupled with an electronic brake force distribution. This will help in gaining extra control over the vehicle on all kinds of roads. This is not offered to the base trim. Additionally, electronic power assisted steering system that is very responsive. A minimum turning radius of about 4.8 meters is good for handling the vehicle on narrow roads.Ed's Take:\u000a The Etios Cross petrol gets all the safety features airbags and ABS, however, this is an optional package on the diesel version.\u000a Plenty of features are equipped in this section to provide strong protection to the vehicle as well as to the passengers. Airbags are present for the driver and co-driver too which are based on supplemental restraint system. An anti-lock braking system with an electronic brake force distribution is equipped in GD variant. A keyless entry and an engine immobilizer will minimize theft related worries by avoiding unauthorized access. Its body structure is well built in order to reduce the impact caused by collision. A high mount stop lamp is fitted at the rear end and we can see a defogger integrated to the rear windscreen. Furthermore, there is a wiper fixed to this glass. Other safety features include a parking brake warning, door ajar, driver seat belt and headlamp on reminders as well which are embedded into the instrument panel.A 15-inch diamond cut alloy wheels are equipped to all the trims. A set of tubeless radial tyres of size 185/60 R16 are covered over these rims. Additionally, boot compartment has a full size spare wheel along with a tool kit which will be useful in changing a flat tyre.1. Shoulder and head space is an advantage. 2. Plenty of comfort enhancing features. 3. Very compelling external design. 4. Performance of the diesel motor is impressive. 5. Cabin is uniquely designed.1. Boot space is less. 2. Petrol variants are not fuel efficient. 3. Lack of leather upholstery. 4. Price range a notch too high. 5. Safety quotient needs to be improved.

The steering doesn't come with any additional controls. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe black fabric seats with white inserts attracts the eye. The seats are not too rigid but fairly cushion. The rear cabin has non-split folding bench seat that helps to release extra boot volume. On a whole the new Punto Pure is satisfying with the entertainment aspect and is quite positive with the seating and comfort.\u000a\u000aPerformance:\u000a\u000aPetrol:\u000a\u000aThe new Punto Pure Petrol variant operates with 1.2-litre FIRE petrol engine. Fuel supply for the motor is done through the Multi point Fuel Injection System. The engine has a displacement of 1198 cc. It produces a maximum power of 67bhp at 6000 rpm and delivers a maximum torque of 96 Nm at 2500 rpm.

However the mileage on city roads might come out as lag for this pretty ride.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDiesel:\u000a\u000aThe second engine is a highly acclaimed and most awarded 1.3 litre Advanced Multi-jet diesel power plant. This engine has a displacement capacity of 1248cc. Fuel for this diesel engine is supplied through common rail fuel injection technology. The performance of the diesel engine is quite impressive. It does the job well by producing 75bhp of maximum power at 4000 rpm and 197Nm of maximum torque at 1750rpm.

It is currently available only in one trim level that has a few essential protective features. It has door open indicator, Fire prevention system  and Engine immobilizer with rolling code that maximizes the safety quotient. In addition to these, the car also have fire prevention system, follow-me home headlights, driver seatbelt warning, double crank prevention system and rear seat metal back. The major concern with the new Fiat Punto Pure is the lack of Airbags which now is common is most vehicles at the same price tag.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVariants\u000a:\u000a\u000aThe new Punto Pure is currently available in two variants, which have standard facilities on-board. The list includes interior roof light, hight adjustable front head restraints, fixed rear seat head restraints, digital clock, follow-me home headlights and a programmable speed limit buzzer.

In terms of performance, its diesel engine outperforms ever other rival in its class, however the petrol engine lacks that punch. Price is yet another positive factor that can lure buyers. On a whole, this motor is affordable carrying decent looks and features.

VIntroduction:\u000aFerrari is one of the very few brands that has emboldened itself in history. The Italian manufacturer commands respect like few corporations ever have, with engineering for the auto-realm that has transcended new borders. This is a brand that has imported F-1 design marvels for the regular roads, and honed them into an avatar of comfort and radiance that suits the modern crowd. We'd personally say we've found no vehicle as mind-blowing as this one. We know for one that many of the new auto-audience would feel exactly the same way, and so here we are, to give you our detailed analysis of this monster. \u000a\u000aPros:\u000a1. Awe-inciting visual aspect, sure to get any car-lover's approval.\u000a2. Incomparable performance features, far beyond the average capacity of any Indian model.\u000aCons:\u000a1. A complete lack of comfort, convenience and entertainment facilities within is surely a down-mark.\u000a2. The cabin has just enough space for two people, and this may disappoint luxury-attuned customers.\u000aStand-Out Features:\u000a1. It has a wide slew of techno aids to go along with its performance, ranging from ABS to Side Slip Control System, and this is definitely an up-vote for many of today's buyers.\u000aOverall:\u000aHere is a machine that brings some real sizzle into the market. The Ferrari 488 GTB is an encapsulation of what every young Indian car lover could ever want, from speed, power and acceleration. With an iron-fisted V8 engine that displaces nearly 4000cc, this is the ideal machine to awaken the speed-lover in you. Only a handful of on-road vehicles have ever come close to its mighty performance, and most of them belong either to this manufacturer, or its only competitor, Lamborghini. Aside from the performance, the vehicle hits a nerve with its formidable exterior display. Its agile and balanced stance makes for a display of engineering perfection that few companies would bother with. Its tense, hawk-like stance gives it a bold, commanding aura that goes beyond its lack of size and weight.  While we dig into the machine to bring you the goods and the bads, we'd like you to view this as a vehicle that's suited not for every ordinary driver, but for a specific niche of drivers that most people would fantasise of being. \u000aExteriors:\u000aThere are few people in the world that could take a look at this machine, and not feel spellbound, and we've got to say, we weren't among them. This is a Ferrari, folks, and it would be a disgrace to expect anything less exhilarating in the machine's image. It takes on a low, sharp and powerful shape that gives it the ferocious look of an F1 car wrapped over to run in city roads. \u000a\u000aApart from its mouth-watering visual delight, the car's bullet-like shape helps to facilitate the right airflow around it when driving, thereby keeping resistance at the minimum. This makes the key point for the machine's incredible speed capacity, as well as its incomparable road agility.\u000a\u000aYou can sense the steely character of the vehicle with the sharp posture of the front, and this portrays an aggressive aura over the machine. \u000a\u000aThe massive air dams at the bottom invite a more dynamic allure for the front, and we thought that this blended perfectly with the brazen, sporty vision of the vehicle. The slender headlamps flow upwards towards the bonnet, giving a bolder, radiant expression for the face that you've never likely seen in any other car before. \u000a\u000aRefined curvatures press into the hood, while the clean lines streaking it add to the mesmerising effect of the front. The skin of the front beefs out over the wheel arches by the side, bringing a more muscular texture to the area that we're sure modern audiences would love. \u000a\u000aMeanwhile, strong lines cleave the door sides and the rear region, and we thought that the overall effect was stunning. The rear area has been pumped with a well toned, masculine effect, and this energises the machine's overall layout. \u000a\u000aThe wheel rims are just gorgeous, and their spectacular design goes out of the way to underline the machine's sporty imprint.\u000a\u000aWhen you stand before the vehicle, the smooth, balanced structure does make for a raw effect. The rear area has been given a heavier proportion, raised higher than the front in a perfectly streamlined profile. \u000a\u000aThe dynamic, sporty exhaust pipes at the rear are sure to get most people going, wrapped within the massive, black region by the skirt. \u000a\u000aThe smooth textured skin streams into the rear from the side, almost artistically melding into the region, with the rear window leaning inward for a slightly more pronounced feel. The circular lights resting by the corner weave a distinguished effect for the image in our opinion. With the prancing horse stationed at the centre of the rear region, the powerful image of the vehicle is finished off with an expensive touch. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInteriors:\u000aThe interiors aren't really spacious, and we're sure you don't have to be a genius to figure that out. This is a small, cramped cockpit that is specifically designed for one purpose of taking the brunt of intense speeds. We don't blame if you feel nauseous, given that the fighter-jet style design did push a constricted feeling upon us too. \u000a\u000aThe cockpit can service two people, and some might detect a shortage of legroom. Taller, huskier and broad shouldered people would definitely flinch while seated in here, but those of moderate design might feel more comfortable. \u000a\u000aDespite the lack of comfort and space, the cabin does incorporate an element of style and modernity that makes up for it. The dashboard spreads over front with a very fancy red-black combination design that we found amazing. The top half of the dash has a smooth black colour pattern. Unique designed AC vents wrapped in a silver surround are present by the corners of the dash, and side of the wheel. The bottom layer of the dash is dressed in a glaring red, along with patches of the door sides and other regions of the cabin. \u000a\u000aYou almost get the feel that the company has ignited its well known, sporty side with the racy red-black design of the cabin. By the right side of the dash, the steering wheel section looks quite a bit like a cluster of many different screens, buttons and devices. \u000a\u000aThe wheel has been established with the same, sporty design that all models of the company have, and we know for one that younger passengers will love this. The yellow Ferrari emblem is lodged by the centre of the wheel, with other operational buttons integrated into the bottom. \u000a\u000aAt the front of the vehicle, the instrument cluster has a pretty sophisticated design, aligning with the theme of the rest of the cabin. A large tachometer sits by the centre of the cluster, with a navigation display by the right and a screen displaying the speed by the left. This does take a turn from the conventional design that instrument clusters come with these days, but we thought it brought a touch of ingenuity to the cabin. \u000a\u000aComing to the seating arrangement, the sports-style seats make for a really strong element of comfort, keeping you well braced for the high speed dashes that this machine is made for. The plush leather upholstery refines the entire experience, while the integrated headrests ensure that no stone is left unturned in pursuit of comfort. \u000a\u000aPerformance:\u000aThis is the section that defines this vehicle. What we're seeing here, ladies and gentlemen, is one of the fastest road cars released in history. The company has packed the machine with a V8 engine that displaces a mammoth 3902cc. It flaunts some awesome figures, including a power of 661bhp at 8000rpm, and a pounding torque of 760Nm. The engine is equipped with a 200-bar direct fuel injection system, enabling flawless fuel transfer. The engine is geared along with a 7-speed dual clutch transmission, and we thought that the shifting capacity was as solid as it could get. You can't help but admire the zeal with which the power-train has been built, with some of the most high quality design elements that fortify its working. Firstly, it has been modelled with a flat-plane crankshaft architecture, which optimises the engine's fluid dynamics and minimises mass. Apart from this, the turbos are held on ball-bearing-mounted shafts for maximum efficiency during the ride. All of this and more helps keep the engine at its maximum tune, carrying this car past all performance barriers known to ordinary cars. The vehicle zooms to a top speed of 330kmph, and if this doesn't stun you, then nothing will. It can rip from 0 to 100kmph within 3 seconds flat, just about the time an ordinary person takes two breaths. The time taken to sweep to 200kmph is 8.3 seconds, faster than what most models take to reach 100kmph. What more is left to be said?\u000a\u000a\u000aRide and Handling:\u000aLike most other super-cars, the brazen and speedy side of this vehicle has been well shielded by strong braking and chassis arrangement. Firm discs have been fastened onto all the wheels, and the braking process is as smooth as it gets for a machine of this calibre. Nevertheless, you're likely to be thrown around, considering that the car can shoot to inhumane speeds of nearly 330kmph. Body roll is, however, negligent, and all other facets of comfort were well sealed. The muscular chassis system is capable of swallowing almost everything the road throws at it, but knowing Indian roads, you might need to be prepared for a little rish-rash with pot-holes and other anomalies. Apart from the inner dynamics, the company has imbued the machine with a host of advanced techno aids, ensuring that the prowess of the engine is balanced out by as secure a ride environment as it gets. A magneto-rheological damping system adjusts the ride system so that all bumps and road anomalies are digested with ease. Apart from this, a new Brembo Extreme Design braking system helps to pull off a smooth, easy and safe braking for the machine, while at the same time, reducing the stopping distance for a more efficient ride. Also present as additional driver aids are Side Slip Control System, which provide assistance during cornering, and a Variable Torque Management System, which balances the vehicle's ride stability with its torque delivery. Also present are well known aid programs, including the Anti-lock Braking System, which helps to keep the vehicle stable on all grooves. \u000a\u000aSafety:\u000aFerrari has placed itself as one of the world's most sought after brands, and its credit derives not just from its spine-tingling speed capacities, but also from its uncompromising safety standards. This vehicle comes along with numerous advanced and conventional safety aids, ranging from airbags and seatbelts to integrated head restraints. The high performance radials adorned over the wheels help the vehicle maintain a firm grip over the road always, while at the same time, easing handling for the driver. High-tech drive programs go out of the way to deepen the safety regard for the vehicle, ranging from the ABS to Variable Torque Management System and many others. All of this and more together help to stabilise the machine's untameable side, ensuring that the occupants are kept as safe as possible. We couldn't help but feel a level of peace in the atmosphere, with the justified attention that the company has directed to the safety area. \u000a\u000aVerdict:\u000aThis here is one of the finest cars, from one of the finest car makers in history. And we're going to have to leave you with a massive list of advantages, as well as some very scalding cons as well. Let's not argue about this, but here is a machine that nobody would be able to resist. The 488 GTB has it all, from the jaw-dropping looks to the unimaginable speed skills. It is perhaps one of the top ten fiercest road cars ever made, and we're sure of it when we say nobody likes to turn such a vehicle down. However, it does come with some disadvantages as well, foremost among which is the price. This is not the type of car that people in this country would be able to give a go to. Apart from this, the cabin has hardly enough space to carry two adults, and it has virtually no entertainment and comfort aspects. In the end, this is a car specially made for people with a fat wallet, who would compromise a regular ride experience for the sole purpose of an adrenaline packed race experience. For others like you and me, stay out of the way of this beast. \u000a\u000a

VIt seems like the season of new launches has started in India with the introduction of the all new \u000aVolvo V40\u000a hatchback in the country. This is an entry level luxury hatchback from the Swedish auto giant, which is available in a diesel engine option only. It is nothing but a stripped down version of the popular V40 Cross Country model as it ditches rugged exterior cosmetics like side cladding, a pair of roof rails and skid plates. At the same time, its ground clearance too is reduces for a supple drive experience. Its front bumper is in body color featuring a sleek air intake section for a decent appearance. However, the D3 R-Design trim differentiates itself with its exclusive aspects like blacked-out grille, specially crafted alloy wheels, a new paint shade and panoramic glass roof. Coming to the insides, this vehicle gets a premium interior design borrowed from its bigger sibling. It flaunts a two-tone color scheme that is highlighted by extensive metallic accents. However, the top end version gets a tailor-made R-Design package that renders it an ultra-modern look. Not just its interior design, but most of the features too have been borrowed from the cross country model. Currently, this vehicle is being brought to India through CBU route, which makes it hard for it to be a tough contender against the likes of Mercedes-Benz A-Class and BMW 1 Series.In terms of specifications, it borrows the same D3 diesel engine from the Cross Country version. Which means, it carries a 2.0-litre, four-cylinder engine under the hood. This is mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission gearbox as standard and is a front-wheel-drive. This vehicle has a range of innovative features including a fully digital instrument cluster, an automatic climate control unit and an advanced infotainment system.

This hatch has a dual tone rear bumper, while its front one is in body color. There is a small air intake section on the front bumper accompanied by LED DRLs. The radiator grille has a thin chrome surround and is complimented by a company emblem positioned in the center. Another attractive aspect is the headlight cluster with projector lamps along with black accents, which adds to its bold appeal. Not to forget that the expressive slanting forward bonnet is another aspect that emphasizes its aerodynamic stance. On the other hand, the R-Design trim gets a fixed panoramic sunroof as standard. At the same time, there are metallic accents on the A pillars, which can be seen from the frontage. This hatchback has a stylish side facet owing to its low stance and bigger fenders. This exclusive trim also gets a special set of alloy wheels as part of R-Design package. While the door handles along with ORVM caps have been painted in body color. However, the top end version gets the outside mirrors in a glossy non-body color that emphasizes its exclusivity. This vehicle has a unique rear facet thanks to the glossy black finishing on its tailgate embedded with 'VOLVO' lettering. Enhancing this swanky stance is the taillight cluster that has an attractive lighting pattern featuring LEDs.Exterior Measurements:This luxury hatchback has a total length measuring at 4369mm and a width stretching about 1857mm (excluding the outside mirrors). Its overall height stands at 1420mm, which is quite low. This vehicle has a very long wheelbase of 2647mm.The manufacturer has introduced this vehicle in two variants among which, the top end trim gets a black colored interior. It is further complimented by the contrast top-stitching given to the leather upholstery. At the same time, it also gets brushed metallic accents all-over that distinguishes it from other luxury models. Its dashboard comprises of a digital instrument cluster along with a infotainment system and several control switches. The seating is very comfortable, thanks to its ergonomic design accompanied by side bolsters. The floor console in the cockpit houses a gearbox along with a storage unit. The space inside the vehicle is lavish and is good enough to host five occupants.Interior Comfort:The best of comfort features are offered in this vehicle, which makes the drive quite enjoyable. Starting with its ergonomically designed seats, they are integrated with headrests and provide enhanced support. The height and angle of its front seats can be adjusted, which also help in giving proper under-thigh support. The heating function additionally makes its passengers feel warm, when driving in freezing temperatures. On the other hand, the split folding function for its rear seat, aids to bring in more luggage inside. It is bestowed with climate control, while the dust and pollen filter assists in purifying the cabin air. An adaptive TFT instrumentation is another aspect, whose color changes based on different driving modes. In particular, the availability of a panoramic sunroof made of dark tinted laminated glass, is a plus point. It not only gives a thrilling feel, but also protects from UV radiation. It has power adjustable door mirrors, which are heated as well. To further add to the convenience, it includes both front and rear power windows, which can be easily lowered or raised just at the press of a button. An advanced music system is also offered, which supports Bluetooth connectivity and has a touchscreen display. In addition to all these, it also includes cruise control function, rain sensing wipers, sliding armrest, sun visors equipped with illuminated vanity mirrors, reverse camera, heated windscreen, automatically dimmed inside mirror, and a few others that adds to the comfort quotient.Interior Measurements:This stunning hatch ensures a plenty of cabin space to its passengers considering its interior dimensions. The head and shoulder room is quite good, while the leg space is also quite sufficient. A good amount of luggage can be stored inside and by folding its rear seat, the boot compartment can be further increased. Whereas, a 60-litre fuel tank incorporated in it, is ample for planning long drives.Ed's take: \u000a The 150bhp makes the Volvo V40 a quick hatchback. The torque produced at the low end adds more punch to it.\u000a  Both the variants, which is equipped with a diesel engine are mated to a six speed geartronic automatic transmission gearbox. This helps it to achieve a top speed of 200 Kmph and can accelerate from 0 to 100 Kmph mark in mere 9.3 seconds.Ed's take: \u000a The V40 produces sufficient power to drive in city or the highway, but even to make those quick overtaking moves.\u000a  This model is available in two variants both of which, carry the 2.0-litre diesel mill.

This motor can generate 150bhp peak power and yields torque output of 350Nm between 1500 and 2750rpm.Ed's take: \u000a The V40 returns a fuel economy of about 16km/l as per the ARAI cycle. In real world, it should return about 11-12km/l.\u000a  Introduced in the luxury hatchback segment, this vehicle is available with a diesel engine option only. It has a 2.0-litre engine that is integrated with a direct fuel injection technology. This vehicle features an engine start/stop technology helping it to deliver a maximum mileage of 23.25 Kmpl, which is rather impressive considering its size and stature.Ed's take: \u000a The power produced by the V40 is good, and at about 150bhp of power at tap it is good for its size.\u000a  It houses a five cylinder mill that has a displacement capacity of 1984cc. This power plant can generate a commanding power of 150bhp in combination with a hammering torque of 350Nm.Ed's take: \u000a The V40 being a luxury hatchback gets all the frills one will need in a luxury car.\u000a  A sophisticated audio unit is one among the most innovative features this model is bestowed with.

VIntroduction: Fiat India, the subsidiary of the Italian automobile firm is operating its business in the country for almost two decades. However, it never really managed to be successful in the country thanks to its obsolete model line-up and tough competition from the likes of Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai. Since two years, this firm is trying hard to break into the Indian market by launching new models and by updating its fleet. Now, at the 2016 Auto Expo, it pulled-off covers over the so called Fiat Avventura Urban Cross that managed to grab the attention of on-lookers. Based on the existing Fiat Avventura crossover, this newly unveiled model is said to be coming with two engine options. It is unclear when the product will be launched in the country, buy reports suggest that the vehicle will be ready for a launch in third quarter. Pros:1. The external appearance of the concept Avventura Urban Cross looks stunning. It is a typical Italian car with great build quality. 2. Its interiors are spacious and seating seems comfortable.Cons:1. Interior design lacks the sheer quality of a premium car.\u000a\u000aStandout features:1. It features a high resolution touchscreen infotainment system with Bluetooth, USB and other standard equipments.2. With 1.4-litre T-jet petrol engine under the hood, it can outperform all other performance cars in its class.Overview:It is perhaps for the first time in India, Fiat has managed to steal the attention with its newly unveiled model. Although, the car is based on the Avventura, it looks evidently different from the existing one. It is most likely that the car maker will launch the product with two engine options. It is too early to speculate about the variant line-up or regarding the features that the car could come with. However, by looking at the company's moves since last two years, we can expect for a few surprises with this Urban Cross. It is most likely that the car would be launched in the festive season. Soon after its arrival, it would go against the likes of Volkswagen Cross Polo, Ford EcoSport and others in its class. Exteriors:The exteriors of the Avventura Urban Cross is something that will surprise you. It is perhaps the best looking car designed by Fiat so far. Although, the design and its construction is based on the lines of Avventura crossover, it looks drastically different from the former. It has a build quality of a premium car that would certainly impress the auto lovers. The front facade of the car has the semblance of other Fiat brand cars with intuitive design, perfect fit and finish. It looks bold and powerful thanks to the sporty bumper, headlight cluster and a distinctive new grille. The headlight cluster has the similar design that can been seen in Punto Evo hatchback. What makes it look different is the distinctive lighting pattern. Its production version could house conventional lamps along with LED DRLs and turn blinkers. The radiator grille has a hexagonal shape with a new diamond cut design, which is the most attractive factor of the car. We can see extensive amount of metallic garnish to the grille that elevates its sporty nature. \u000aUnlike regular crossovers, this one comes with silver garnished sporty body kit that dresses-up the fenders and lower section of the car. These wheel arches have been paired with a set of alloy wheels that adds to its sporty characteristics. The rear section of the car looks much alike Avventura, but with better build quality and finish. The rear windscreen is wider and is accompanied with a spoiler along with a third brake light. The boot-lid is garnished with the company's emblem along with the model's designation. Like its headlight cluster, the rear light cluster too has a distinctive lighting pattern. Also, it can be seen with metallic inserts and LED turn indicators. We have to admit that the car looked stunning at the auto show. It has everything that is needed to grab the attention of a young buyer. Interior:This car shares its interior design with other Fiat cars, especially Punto EVO and Avventura cross. However, we can see extensive use of leatheratte material on the dashboard and seats that helped in bringing a rich appeal to the insides. The manufacturer seems to have focused on improving the quality of the insides with the use of glossy black and leather materials. However, poor plastic quality is something that spoiled all the hardwork. The dual tone gray and black colour scheme was a true stunner, in our opinion, and we felt a more youthly persona invoked by the set-up. The steering wheel comes with a classic three spoke design, and the flat-bottom effect adds to the brilliant look. We also noticed multi-functional switches incorporated into it, and this is sure to ease the driver's load in many lengths. The instrument cluster has been positioned within the field of sight of the driver, ensuring least disruption during the drive. Incorporated into the cluster is a tachometer, along with a speedometer, both of which come with well-designed, attractive dials that are sure to add a spark to the driver's experience. We thought the layout of the dashboard reflected a strong, sophisticated art, with a more modern structure for the centre console. The AC ducts are present over the console, and at the heart is the audio system display. The buttons for the system     have been smeared around the display, and this builds up a more harmonious look in our opinion. Moving away from the centre console, the car's door panels have been graced with an eye catching design, and the finish adds to the resplendent allure. You're sure to love the contrasting colour schemes that stretch over the doorsides, making for a more artistic impression within the car. There are thin orange lines that circle the AC vents, and surround the centre console, and we thought this added a more spiced-up and distinctive effect for the entire place. Meanwhile, the ergonomically built seats are sure to come with fine fabric, and you can also keep your fingers crossed that the company would do the honour of giving leather upholstery. Performance:As of now, we can't confirm anything about the vehicle, but as we followed online news sources, we found that the vehicle was likely to come with the same engine that powers the Fiat Abarth Avventura. The 1.4-litre T-Jet petrol engine is a decent performer, yielding a power of 138bhp at 5500rpm, along with a torque of 210Nm at 2000rpm to 4000rpm. We thought that specs spoke for themselves, but we've got to inform you that there are other vehicles in this segment that boast better characteristics. The engine's power is to be channelled through a 5-speed manual shifter, and we expect the shifting to be a rather smooth affair, giving this company's track record. As for the handling of the engine, we're unable to tell you about the engine's drive quality, for this vehicle has been kept well blanketed from the media and news outlets. Ride and Handling:Fiat has demonstrated a sound understanding of our country's road conditions, for as we drove other, closer models of the brand, we thought the overall quality was great. Bumps and jerks are sure to be expected, considering the untameable condition of Indian roads. We're happy to bet that this model will carry the same drive characteristics, except with very small nuances in the driving style. Strong discs would be worn at the front and rear wheels, and this is sure to ease out the stopping and cornering process. We hear rumours of other conventional drive programs such as the Anti-lock braking system, as well as the Electronic stability control, although we can't confirm these for sure. The chassis arrangement is usually left for no compromise, and you'd be safe to expect a McPherson strut at the front and a rigid Torsion beam at the rear, helping to cement a strong handling. We're willing to cast our hopes out that this vehicle's handling and overall drive quality goes further than most people would believe. With its well aligned dimensions, it's sure to be a pleasant experience to drive, with minimal discomforts and strains. Safety:Airbags, seatbelts with pre-tensioners, a warning for open doors and unbuckled seatbelts, strong LED headlamps and many other strong facilities that strengthen safety could be expected. You could also hope for advanced techno programs to cement the safety quotient, preserving the overall ride stability and keeping the occupants both comfortable and at ease. Variants and Verdict:As for the variants, we are unable to chart out the exact trim levels. However, there obviously would be varying trim levels that come with a diverse range of features and differing price tags. All in all, we're sure that this is going to be one heck of a release, for it's already set ripples across the Indian car market. Like most other car-enthusiasts, we're more than happy to see vehicles like this enter the mainstream market. We'd be counting down the days for its launch to review its performance in the market, to see where it soars, and where it drops.

VOVERVIEW:Introduction:The Skoda entered the Indian market with the Octavia in early 2002. It enjoyed immediate success and helped establish the Czech brand quite quickly. We Indians quickly became fans of the TDi engine and the superb handling it offered. In an attempt to replicate this success in other segments with potentially higher volumes, Skoda launched the Rapid. Let\u2019s see if this car lives up to the hype that its elder siblings enjoy.Pros\u000a:\u000a1. Solid dashboard, great seats, lots of infotainment features. Great Interiors overall.2. Handling continues to be top-notch while the ride comfort is also very decent.Cons\u000a:1. Can prove pricier to maintain/service compared to other cars in the segment.2.The horrible after-sales stories continue to haunt the company. Skoda has been specifically focussing on this aspect since last year, but the verdict is still open.Stand Out Features:\u000a1. After the 2014 update, it now offers the legendary DSG gearbox on its diesel variants. The gearbox provides the best of both the manual and automatic transmissions.2. Optional Black Package for the top-end variants simply oozes style and class.Background and Evolution:The Rapid first entered the market in 2011 with the promise of Skoda\u2019s interior quality and handling levels at a much more pocket-friendly price. The only updates to it in late-2014 have been a new diesel engine and the addition of a new automatic gearbox to this diesel lineup. Interiors have also been spruced up a bit to match the competition, but the overall design has remained the same. A facelift due later this year. EXTERIOR:\u000aThe Skoda Fabia is definitely a very handsome car. It has the trademark European \u2018no-frills\u2019 design which contrasts the flashy, chiseled looks of its Asian competitors.\u000aAt the front, you have the trademark Skoda grille with the black vertical slats and a chrome plated strip resting on top carrying the company\u2019s redesigned badge. The Headlamp clusters on either side look a bit wide-eyed compared to the sleek ones seen on the City, Verna or VW\u2019s own Vento. Their roots in the Octavia are evident and this was perhaps Skoda\u2019s thought process too. Projector headlamps however, are on offer only for the top variant. The sculpted bonnet at the top and the simple fog lamps at the bottom add a touch of elegance to the front face.\u000aComing to the side profile, we see a single, prominent line that runs across the vehicle between the wheel arches. Just enough effort to distinguish it from the Vento perhaps. That aside, the 15-inch wheels fill out the wheel arches sufficiently. The alloy wheels that the top variants get have a new design after the 2014 update and the new ones look much better.\u000aThe rear is where it\u2019s shared platform with the Vento becomes evident. At a glance, the two look identical. The tail lamps however have the C-shaped design that is typical of Skoda. Also, there are two diagonal kinks flanking the nameplate on either side and one horizontal kink below it that are absent in the Vento. Overall it still maintains the simple, classy look that befits the Skoda badge.\u000aThe Rapid is almost the same size as the Vento and just like the Vento, it has the least height and wheelbase in its segment. This might not bode well for the 5th occupant.\u000aIn terms of boot space, the Skoda turns out to be the lowest while the Vento is actually on the higher end of the spectrum. Might not be a deal breaker for most, but Skoda definitely knows a thing or two about creating room, so we expected more.INTERIOR\u000a:\u000aOn getting inside, the dual-tone interiors that greet us are soothing to look at. Every aspect of the interiors looks strictly functional and gives the car an old-school charm. The build quality also feels very solid. \u000aThe front seats have solid support all round, with a height-adjustable center armrest. The height-adjustable driver\u2019s seat coupled with a steering wheel adjustable for rake and reach make the driver\u2019s seat a very comfortable place to be in.\u000aThe instrument cluster has a simple two dial layout with display in between for additional information. Steering mounted controls feel solid, so does the leather-wrapped steering wheel itself. The center console is a standard affair, with the infotainment system having all the latest tech-wizardry. Lack of a touchscreen however betrays the car\u2019s age in an otherwise great interior. There are chrome linings at various places on the center console and steering wheel for added elegance. Top end variants get Automatic Climate Control too. \u000aThe new automatic gearbox for the diesel variants was one of the significant changes made during the 2014 update. The Shifter flaunts the presence of this famed DSG gearbox by having the initials etched on it. The all-black knob with a lining of chrome feels very ergonomic to use. A 12V port in front of it flanked by two cubby holes round out the features here.\u000aThe rear seats are also quite roomy, with rear AC vents enhancing the comfort levels. The fifth occupant may feel a bit cramped during short journeys and for longer journeys the Rapid is definitely a four-seater only.\u000aStorage spaces overall are more than ample. You have cup holders with flip frames at the front and rear. Standard bottle holders on all doors, cubby holes below the front armrest and in the centre console are sure to address all your needs.PERFORMANCE\u000a:\u000aThere are two engine options for the Rapid, a 1.6L MPI petrol and 1.5 TDI diesel. Both engine options have a manual and an automatic variant.PETROL\u000a:\u000aThe petrol engine puts out 105bhp at 5250 rpm and 153 Nm of torque at 3800 rpm. The engine is not exactly the most responsive one in this segment. However it does accelerate well and the torque also feels a bit higher throughout its rev range. The 5-speed manual gearbox is definitely one of the smoothest we have seen. It has short throws and the gearing is clever enough to cover up for the engine\u2019s shortfalls. The 6-speed automatic does make things interesting by having a S mode for more Sporty behaviour. However, its regular mode (D-mode) feels quite laggy and is best suited for bumper-to-bumper traffic only. Chasing triple-digit speeds and overtaking feels more convenient in the S mode.\u000aDiesel:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe diesel has been downsized from 1.6L to 1.5L after the 2014 update. But it still continues to generate the same 105bhp@4400rpm and 250Nm@1500-2500rpm that the larger engine generated. The torque is certainly at the higher end of the spectrum in this segment, the highest being 260Nm generated by the 1.6L diesel in the Verna. Since this torque is available right from 1500rpm, the diesel does feel light on its feet. However, the refinement levels feel a bit lacking at higher rpms as the engine can get disturbingly noisy. This comes as quite a surprise to us, as this was not the case for the earlier, larger engine.The 5-speed manual is a great match for this engine and can make both city driving and highway cruising a breeze. The star however, is the newly introduced DSG box. This is a 7-speed box used in the Vento diesel and not the 6-speed box used in the Octavia. This too has the S and D modes like the petrol does. But in this case, the D-mode was much better, with the shifts happening fast and there was no sluggishness at all! It makes best use of the torque available across a wide rpm range and keeps you on the move irrespective of the speed. The S mode, as expected, is good for highway driving but can prove a bit too jumpy and difficult to drive in the city as the throttle is much more sensitive. Also, the engine stays at higher revs for longer in S mode and this does not bode very well for the TDI as it can get quite whiny.\u000aRIDE AND HANDLING:\u000aThe Rapid has different setups for the Diesel and the Petrol versions. The diesel has its suspension setup on the stiffer side as expected, but what was not expected was the ease with which it could glide over potholes even with a stiffer suspension. At the same time, this same stiffness ensured that the vehicle remains planted around turns and over any major potholes even at high speeds. Body roll is very well controlled. The petrol on the other hand, was effective at normal speeds, soaking in bumps very easily. At highway speeds however, the soft suspension led to too much movement and did not inspire confidence like the diesel. The suspension and the TDI+DSG combo make the Diesel version of the Rapid a much better car to drive. Braking was top notch on both petrol and diesel variants.SAFETY:Skoda has always been considered as the more premium brand as compared to its plain-jane VW cousins. In keeping with this image, it has ensured that all its vehicles have the safety features that a premium badge commands. Dual front airbags are standard across all variants, with ABS and ESC being offered for all variants except the base one. ESC is offered only for diesel automatic transmission. Other features like fuel supply cut-off in crash, Reverse parking distance control (Parktronic) and a sound-based warning signal for excess speed are also built into the vehicle for better safety.\u000aVARIANTS\u000a:\u000aAs you can see, Skoda has covered most bases in the base Active variant itself and by the time you reach the mid-level variant, you have most bells and whistles you require. But the gearbox, engine and variant combinations can get a little confusing here, so let us break it down for you.If you are going for an automatic vehicle, the diesel is a no-brainer. Going for the Ambition variant should give you good value for money. The major things you might miss out on will be the Halogen headlamps, Cruise control and Automatic climate control. If you are going for a manual transmission, the petrol has one of the smoothest gearboxes around. So that should be your choice if you want pure driving pleasure. If practicality is also in mind, you can go for Ambition trim for diesel too.One interesting thing about the Rapid is the Black Package that is being offered at a premium of Rs. 13,000. This trim looks really great and is definitely worth the money in our opinion, if you are willing to spend it. Obligatory picture of this beautiful machine below. \u000a\u201cWicked\u201d is the word you\u2019re looking for.VERDICT:\u000aWhen looking at the Rapid, you would start off with its closest competitor, the Vento. It is basically the same car underneath but offers much more value. In terms of the segment in which it sits, the build is top notch and performance figures are sufficient to excite you. The only down sides we see is the feature list. However, the bigger concern is the after sales service of Skoda.

VBMW 1 Series is the least expensive model in the company's portfolio, but still, it hasn't lived upto the expectations. Even after having an intuitive list of features under its belly, it turned out to be a slow-selling product for the manufacturer. Now, in a move to spur its sales, the car maker has introduced its facelift version in the country. Available only in one 118d Sport Line trim, this vehicle comes equipped with a 2.0-litre diesel engine. Earlier this year at the Geneva Motor Show, this facelift version was displayed to the enthusiasts and now, it has silently made its entry into the Indian shores. As compared to its predecessor, it has slightly grown taller and longer making room for more space inside the cabin. As for the changes outside, it gets a new set of headlights and a pronounced radiator grille enhancing its overall sporty silhouette. Its side facet remains identical to its previous model, but the rear gets 'L' shaped taillights. Additionally, the rear bumper now features dual exhaust pipes. Coming to the insides, the design remains the same, but the use of updated upholstery and metallic accents brings a refreshing new look to the cabin.\u000a \u000a The manufacturer is offering it a dual-zone automatic climate control as a standard feature. This vehicle also gets an updated iDrive infotainment system with a 6.5-inch high resolution display as standard. Apart from this, all the other features of this hatchback have been retained. This version of the 1 Series gets Sport Line styling package as standard, which redefines its class and elegance. The elements included in this pack includes high gloss black kidney grille with 8-slats, entry sills with BMW designation, tailpipes in black chrome and sport leather wrapped steering wheel. This is the hatchback packed with state-of-the-art features like an intelligent energy management system. This is a function that collaborates with automatic start/stop function, steering wheel and brake energy regeneration to ensure maximum performance and sustainable mobility. Also present in this car is the driver assistance package that comprises of camera-based functions like approach control, departure warning and person warning. This intelligent technology operates in step and applies brakes in the event of an emergency. With such hi-tech features and improved cosmetics, this series will give a tough fight against the likes of Mercedes Benz A Class and Volvo V40.Coming to the exterior design, this latest version flaunts its refreshing looks with a new set of cosmetics. On the front facade, we can see the redesigned headlight cluster with all-LED lighting. In the center, the kidney bean shaped grille also received an updated and is garnished in high gloss black. The beauty of its front facade is elevated by the company's logo on top of the hood. Below this grille, the body colored bumper gets a new design with two air ducts and a bigger air dam. Round shaped fog lamps can be seen over the air ducts with sleek chrome strips. Additionally, the lower section of the bumper is fitted with a high-gloss black protection guard rendering a sporty appeal to the frontage. Side profile remains largely similar to the outgoing model, but there is an update with regards to its wheels. Its fenders are now fitted with 'Star-Spoke' styled alloy wheels embodying company's logo in the center. Door handles remain in body color, but the external rear view mirrors have been garnished in glossy black. They are further integrated with turn indicators along with mirror heating and memory function. Complimenting these mirrors are the window sills and B pillars, which are also done up in black. The rear section also gets some new cosmetics in the form of 'L' shaped tail lights. The tailgate and the windscreen didn't get any update, but the bumper gets a new look with dual exhaust pipes in black chrome. Its increased length and height are another factor that makes this hatchback look superior than others in its class.\u000a \u000a Exterior Measurements:\u000a \u000a \u000a As specified above, this hatchback has grown bigger in its size. It now has an overall length measuring 4329mm and a height standing at 1440mm. Its total width including the outside mirrors measures at 1984mm. Now, it also has a longer wheelbase of 2690mm, which indicates an improvement in its cabin space.Ed's Take:\u000a The 1 Series has good quality interiors however it is a bit too dull  and boring styling. Other competitors are much more stylish and  contemporary.\u000a Although the cabin design remains the same, the updated upholstery and metallic accents render a rejuvenating appeal to the interiors. The space inside the cabin has also gone up with better head and leg room. This eventually offers better comfort and convenience than its predecessors. There are lots of silver accents inside the cabin that helped the company obtain rich finishing inside. We can see that the central console area, door trims, and steering wheel gets chrome treatment. Additionally, there are high-gloss black design on center fascia, which adds to the elegance. There is a three spoke steering wheel, which is fully covered with premium leather upholstery and mounted with volume control and call function buttons. The instrument cluster now gets a speedometer and rev counter with red chrono scales adding an aura of sophistication to the insides. Most important fact about the cabin is its luxurious seating arrangement with sports seats. These are wide, comfortable, well cushioned and have been covered with an updated upholstery. As we can see that there are a number of storage space have also been included in the cabin, especially on dashboard, floor console and behind front seats. Along with these, there are many other utilities provided inside like cup holders, accessory power socket, interior mirror, sun visors and much more.\u000a \u000a \u000aInterior Comfort:\u000a \u000a \u000a The manufacturer has made some improvements to its convenience aspects ensuring luxury without compromise. The dashboard in its cockpit houses a single zone automatic climate control unit as standard. It also includes AC vents for rear cabin ensuring chilled atmosphere throughout the cabin. Its front armrest has a sliding function along with a facility to store handy things. The dashboard also has a high resolution instrument display with extended contents to provide precise information about the car and its functions. Accompanied with this is a multi-functional sports steering wheel wrapped with leather. It is integrated with a servotronic assistance along with adjustment facilities. The list of other such features include storage compartment package, start/stop button, smokers package and sports seats for driver along with front passenger. Both the front seats also have an electrical adjustment facility including memory settings for driver. Additionally, electrical adjustment function is also provided for outside mirrors, which also have mirror heating and memory function as well. Also, the presence of automatic driving lights and rain sensors boasts the convenience for the driver.\u000a \u000a Interior Measurements:\u000a \u000a \u000a As a result of improvement in its overall height and length, the cabin space has got better. As for the cockpit section, there is a headroom of 1018mm and a shoulder space of 1400mm. While the head and shoulder space in the rear cabin measures at 972mm and 1417mm respectively. The boot space is also huge, but individuals can increase its overall space by folding the rear bench seat in 60:40 split ratio.Ed's Take:\u000a The acceleration produced by the 1 Series is sufficient to drive and overtake in city or the highway. The eight speed transmission means higher top speed.\u000a This is one department where it still falls behind as compared to others. Being mated to an 8-speed Steptronic automatic transmission, it can zoom towards a maximum speed of 212 Kmph. In the mean time, this hatch takes only about 8.1 seconds to clock 100 Kmph mark from a standstill.Ed's Take:\u000a BMW has always had Efficient Dynamics, and the 1 Series isn\u2019t any different. The BMW 1 Series diesel is definitely the pick of the mill.\u000a Currently, there is only one variant that this 1 Series hatchback comes in. It is powered by a 2.0-litre diesel engine, which comprises of 4-cylinders. Integrated with this motor is a twin-power turbocharger that spurs up its overall output. Besides, the common rail fuel injection technology is another reason why it is so efficient. Having a displacement capacity of 1995cc, this mill can churn out a maximum power of 148bhp at 4000rpm that results in a maximum torque output of 320Nm in the range of 1500 to 3000rpm. The torque output is transmitted to the rear wheels with the help of an 8-speed steptronic automatic gearbox. This enables 50:50 load distribution and contributes for better comfort to the occupants.Ed's Take:\u000a The fuel efficiency of the diesel 1 Series is good, it increases with the new eight-speed transmission and other features like ECO PRO and regenerative braking.\u000a As against the previous model, this 2015 version is now available only in one variant with av diesel engine option. It is a 4-cylindered mill with a total displacement capacity of 1995cc. Being a bigger and powerful engine, one would expect it to deliver a low mileage, but surprisingly, it produces 23.26 Kmpl.Ed's Take:\u000a The power produced by the 1 Series diesel is more than the petrol. The power might sound less, but for a hatchback and a eight speed transmission its more than sufficient.\u000a This 2.0-litre oil-burner comprises of a twin-power turbocharger for enhanced power generation and optimum performance. This allows it to unleash a maximum power of 148bhp that results in a hammering torque of 320Nm.Ed's Take:\u000a The 1Series comes loaded with several frills and one can also customise the 1 Series like any other BMW that is currently available in the market.\u000a Like any other BMW vehicle, this model too comes with several BMW ConnectDrive functions including specialized applications. This system comprises of a Radio BMW Professional featuring an AUX-In socket. Additionally, there is a CD player with MP3 decoder that can play all your music files. Also, USB port and Bluetooth connectivity is also provided for seamless audio streaming. There is a 100W stereo loudspeaker system comprising six speakers all together that delivers exceptional sound quality with crisp bass. Apart from music equipments, there is an iDrive system present with 16.5cms display. It offers controls for audio system with direct menu control buttons. Above all this, there is a Park Distance Control at the rear with sensors. This offers guidelines on the infotainment screen along with acoustic alerts. Optionally, buyers can also opt for a navigation system professional along with an iDrive touch controller. It is a system comprising an USB interface and hands-free facility with voice control function. Additionally it also includes a DVD player as well as a hard drive with 20GB inbuilt storage capacity. It also provides real time traffic information to the driver and enables him/her to take-in alternative route. On the other hand, buyers are provided with a list of exterior and interior accessories. Those include durable all-weather floor mats, BMW urban key case, luggage compartment mats, body decals and alloy wheels.Ed's Take:\u000a BMW has always had strong driving dynamics characteristics and the 1 Series is no different. The steering feel is also amazing.\u000a This is one department, where BMW has never compromised with any of its models. Like other company's products, this 1 Series hatchback too comes with disc brakes fitted to all its four wheels. They are assisted by anti lock braking and cornering brake control. Additionally, brake assist function further augments the mechanism, irrespective of the conditions. A few other functions like dynamic stability control including traction control programs have also integrated for improving the stability. This hatchback also has an advanced servotronic steering assistance that uses the power generated with the help of brake energy regeneration technology. However, the response it offers is precise, which is important for handling any car. On the other hand, its suspension system is something that can take it all the jerks caused on roads enabling optimum comforts to the occupants inside.Ed's Take:\u000a The 1 Series has multiple airbags, ESP and ABS to protect you from any crashes that happen.\u000a Coming to the crucial safety section, this model series has a total of six airbags for front passengers that helps to reduce the risk of injury in case of an accident. The manufacturer has also loaded the safety section with features like anti lock braking system with brake assist, cornering brake control, ISOFIX child seat mounting, runflat tyres with reinforced side walls and side impact protection beams. Also there are three-point seatbelts for all seats including pyrotechnic belt tensioner along with force limiter at front. Additionally, there is an immobilizer with crash sensors that takes the vehicles security to a new height.As a standard fitment, this 118d Sport Line version gets the 17 inch Star-Spoke alloy wheels. They are wrapped with durable, high-quality tubeless radial tyres of size 225/45 R17.1. Redesigned cosmetics adds grace to its exteriors.\u000a \u000a 2. Improved equipments is its plus point.\u000a \u000a 3. Fuel economy is far better than others.\u000a \u000a 4. Interior space got better for more comfort.\u000a \u000a 5. Safety standards are at par with others.1. Low ground clearance is a minus point.\u000a \u000a 2. There is no rear view camera.\u000a \u000a 3. More updates can be given to its side profile.\u000a \u000a 4. iDrive with touch controller could be given as standard.\u000a \u000a 5. Lack of navigation is a disadvantage.

VIntroduction:Maruti Suzuki has long occupied the top spot in the Indian auto space. Cars such as the Alto 800 and the Alto K10 captured the needs of the Indian masses. The Swift goes to show how the company excels in its understanding of the Indian market. This is a vehicle that has hit the right note with the Indian audiences, offering the right balance between quality and price. Released a few years ago, it has performed better in the market than most people back then would have foreseen, and we're here to examine all we can get about the vehicle to find out why.Pros:1. Its cost of ownership is reasonable. 2. Interior environment goes well with the masses. Cons:1. The legroom for the second row could be improved.2. Its engine specs are inferior to class rivals.Stand-Out Features:1. The stereo system that comes along with radio and CD charger is a great ride bonus.Overall:The Swift is offered in four variants, of both petrol and diesel trims. For the petrol version is a K-Series petrol engine, while on the diesel front is a 1248cc DDiS motor. Most people would find the interiors to be just what's needed, with some mediocre style that isn't overdone. Comfort is solidified with many functions ranging from adjustable seats, an accessory socket, power windows, Bluetooth system and many more. When you take stock of the vehicle and its reception, one can't help but think that this is just the type of model needed to pacify the Indian auto-stock every few years.Exteriors:The vehicle has been crafted with a sporty demeanour, and we thought that the company had given it just the tone that audiences today love. Nevertheless, one can spot influences of other models on this one, and this does bring a more favourable aura.The large black grille at the front animates the face, with the Suzuki emblem at the focus of the face. On either side, the headlamp clusters stream upwards in a wave like design, and we thought they brought a more unique theme to the front profile.The large air dam at the bottom of the face invites a more well-integrated image at the front, with fog lamps by the corner. The hood drapes down towards the front skirts, clean and wide without design lines.Meanwhile, the side is given its prominence with the gentle fenders, and the body coloured door handles and mirrors. The well crafted steel wheels do stir some fervour in the look, along with the gentle wheel arches around them. The black highlight on the window frames are also good.The side profile comes without the character lines that are often present in cars these days, and we appreciated the distinctive look this gave to the machine.The rear portion has been given more muscle, and this renders a more balanced look for the model. The tail-lamps at the rear slide outwards towards into the side, and the intricate designing on them improves the look.Fine body cladding runs over the the rear, while the massive bumpers at the rear add a more bold effect to the overall design.Interiors:We thought that the interiors were done up well, although some might feel that the space could have been improved. The front bench offers plenty of legroom, but taller members of our team felt slightly congested at the rear. Nevertheless, there is ample space for your head and shoulders in here.The heavy black interiors might not go well with some, but we personally felt it was great. At the front, the large dashboard stretches over the front, with the glovebox area drooping down towards the passengers' legs.The centre console hosts a stereo unit that comes with a small display screen, and buttons by the side. Controls to the air conditioning system have been poised below this.A small storage unit is present on the floor console, so that the driver and the co passenger can reach for it without hassle. We thought that the 3-spoke steering wheel was good to hold, and easy to operate with. The Suzuki emblem rests at the centre of the wheel, and contrasting silver highlights also hone the look.Positioned within the line of sight of the driver ahead of the wheel is the instrument cluster that hosts a tachometer and a speedometer, both of which come with apt illumination.The seats have been given a good ergonomic structure, and you're sure to face little strain during the ride. Headrests further boost safety and comfort for the occupants. The upholstery is decent, but the lack of leather might lower the standard for some.Performance:Diesel:For diesel versions, there is a DDiS engine that displaces 1248cc. The mill consists of 4 cylinders and 16 valves incorporated together. The company has also armed the motor with a fixed geometry turbocharger that comes along with an intercooler. Fuel delivery takes place through a common rail direct injection. We thought that the specs were decent for its class, with a power of 74bhp at 4000rpm, along with a torque of 190Nm at 2000rpm. The engine's prowess is channelled through a 5-speed manual gearbox. The engine noise is kept well tamed at all speeds, so that highway cruises are also a noise free, peaceful affair. The throttle response is great, and the gear shifting makes the experience even smoother. Petrol:For the petrol side, there is a K-series motor that comes along with the VVT system. It displaces 1197cc, and gives 83.11bhp of power at 6000rpm, and 115Nm of torque at 4000rpm. It has a naturally aspirated air changing system, while a multipoint fuel injection system ensures smooth fuel delivery. The engine has been coupled to the same 5-speed manual gearbox as the diesel variant. The cruising capacity is solid, while the clutch and the gear shifter lighten the driver\u2019s load. You\u2019d have an easy time reaching speeds of nearly 150kmph, and this is more than we\u2019d usually ask for petrol. This engine thrusts the car to high speeds easier and quicker than the diesel variant, but high speeds might make the driver jittery with this mill. Ride and Handling:A combination of ventilated discs and drums fortify the vehicle's braking mechanism. Meanwhile, a McPherson strut has been rigged onto the front axle, with a torsion beam at the rear. We thought that the overall ride was comfortable enough, and irregularities on the road are handled well by the vehicle. Cornering and turning were also a pleasant affair, although high speeds increase hassle during the same. The electronic power steering makes the experience even better, and you're sure to take note of the quick steering response.Safety:The safety facet was at par with segment rivals, but we thought the presence of ABS and EBD was a bonus. Reverse parking sensors, airbags for the front occupants, a brake assist feature, 3-point ELR front seatbelts and a security alarm system ensure peace of mind for the passengers. Also present is a dual horn, a high mounted stop lamp, side door impact beams, head restraints and many more features.Variants:The model series has four variants, LXi LXi(O), VXi and ZDi. The base variant, LXi comes with some basic features, and most people might not find this appeasing. Body coloured bumpers, front 2-speed intermittent wipers, an instrument cluster, a light off reminder buzzer, a low fuel warning lamp, a digital clock and many more nominal facilities bring some comfort home with this variant. The LXi(O) has the same list as the first. Next, the VXi spruces the experience up a little, with a stereo unit that comes with CD player and radio, intelligent speed based audio volume feature, Aux-In and USB facilities, front fog lamps, and OVRMs with turn indicators. The top end trim, ZDi come with a sprawling list that includes a map lamp, Bluetooth and Audio switches in the steering wheel, a front seat belt adjuster, rear window defogger, rear washer and wiper, and an electromagnetic back door opener. We'd recommend the base variants if you're not looking for too much jazz within the vehicle, and would prefer a cheaper price tag. For people who insist on comfort and entertainment, we'd say the top end trims would suit you better. Meanwhile, for those of you looking for something in between, there's always the mid range trims.VerdictThe swift is just the type of car that people of this country would love. It delivers a good ride experience without eating up too much cash, and it comes with some strong western influences for the new generation. On the downside, however, the vehicle's engine specs might let some down, while its considerable lack of lavishness sets it behind other models. We'd tell you this, if you're looking for a car to get you from home to office and vice versa with some good comfort along the way, then you might find a good companion in this model. If you're the type that needs over-the-top luxury and comfort, and can afford it, another model would suit you best.

VIntroduction\u000a\u000a\u000aYou know when Nissan launched the Micra the first time and people called it curvaceous and rounded, which may have put off the prospective male buyers (even the Micra facelift didn\u2019t do much to change this view). So the Renault Nissan Alliance thought it would be better to bring Micra that is more edgy and launched the Renault Pulse, which is basically a Micra with a nose job. Would it be enough to lure in the customers?\u000aPros\u000a1. The front looks good, especially with the GT-R-ish nose; this is essentially what the Micra should have looked like.\u000aCons\u000a1. The cons are more for this one. The Pulse looks more like Micra than we want.\u000a2. Higher pricing than Micra definitely not helping.\u000a3. Micra had a facelift recently while the Pulse remains the same.\u000aExterior\u000a\u000a\u000aSpoiler alert: Renault Pulse doesn\u2019t just look like a Nissan Micra, it is a Nissan Micra. This is a cross badge-ing between Renault and Nissan to save on research and development costs, and it may have sounded like a good idea on the discussion board. But just uplifting a nose and replacing the badges front and rear doesn\u2019t make it a different car.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Micra, er, Pulse looks good from the front, with a sportier grille, inspired by Nissan GT-R and a new bumper. The headlights too get a slight tweak and that sums up the changes in the front.\u000a\u000a\u000aTo the side, there are no visual changes that differentiate the Pulse and Micra in the side profile with only the new alloy wheels acting as the Pulse identifier.\u000a\u000a\u000aComing to the back, the Pulse sports a new rear grille with a diffuser-like black part in the middle. The tail lamps again get a slight tweak to make it the Pulse.\u000a\u000a\u000aInteriors\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Pulse\u2019s interior is the same as the Micra\u2019s except for the logo in the middle of the steering wheel. The Renault Pulses gets a combination of black, beige and light brown interiors.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe dashboard is finished in black, while seats and the doors get beige and light brown combo. The steering wheel feels good in size and to hold. The instrument cluster gets a three dial setup with a large circular speedometer in the middle, a half moon tachometer to the left and a MID on the right.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe centre console holds the rectangular AC vents on the top, audio system in the middle and the circular HVAC controls at the bottom.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Pulse comes with several great features such as start/stop push button, climate control ABS with EBD and dual front airbags.\u000a\u000a\u000aBoth the front and rear seats get adjustable headrests. The Pulse is generous on space in front and as well as the rear.\u000a\u000a\u000aThe front seats are offer great support for the legs and shoulder, while the cushioning is good.\u000a\u000a\u000aAt the rear, you get acres of room for your head and legs while the under thigh support might have been better. The adjustable headrests at the rear are appreciable.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPerformance\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Renault Pulse is available in both petrol and diesel versions. The Pulse petrol is powered by a 1.2-liter engine while the Pulse diesel gets a 1.5-litre engine. Both the engines are offered with a 5-speed manual gearbox only. The CVT gearbox available in the Micra hasn\u2019t been shared with the Pulse yet and remains a Micra-exclusive for now.\u000aPulse Petrol\u000aThe Renault Pulse petrol is powered by a 1198 cc engine putting out 75 hp at 6000 rpm and a maximum torque of 104 Nm at 4000 rpm. The power delivery is good and the petrol engine proves to be more rev happy than its diesel counterpart. The motor delivers a good low-range and mid-range suitable for city driving, while on the highways requires more effort to bring out the best.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPulse Diesel\u000aThe 1461 cc diesel engine is a proven engine for its frugal character and driveability. The low-end power delivery is impressive with very minimal turbo lag. The engine also has a strong mid range performance but take it to the highway and you start to feel the lack of power. You need to carefully plan any overtake and downshifting will be a regular affair on the highways to keep the car up to speed. The 5-speed manual gearbox didn\u2019t have any problem in slotting the gears as required.\u000a\u000a\u000aRide and Handling\u000a\u000a\u000aRenault has opted for a softer suspension setup for the Pulse so the ride quality is very impressive. The Pulse absorbs even rough roads with ease with the suspension taking the irregularities pretty well. Because of the soft suspension, the Pulse\u2019s handling is not sporty enough but not bad as well. The straight line ability of the Pulse is good while around the corners, the body roll does sweep in but the Pulse holds on good enough. The steering wheel is light and weighs on well as the speeds rise.  \u000aSafety\u000a\u000a\u000aRenault Pulse get driver side airbag standard across all the variants. The passenger side airbag is available in the top variant of the diesel version only while the ABS with EBD is available only for the diesel variants. Why Renault? Don\u2019t you want the buyers to buy the petrol variants?\u000a\u000a\u000aVariants\u000aRenault Pulse is available in three variants - one for petrol (RxL) and two for diesel (RxL ABS and RxZ).\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Pulse Petrol comes only in one variant - RxL and you get driver airbag, engine immobilizer, speed-sensing door locks, body coloured bumpers and door handles, rear defogger, rear washer and wiper, front and rear power windows, keyless entry, automatic climate control system and day/night inside rear view mirror.\u000aThe Pulse RxL ABS Diesel comes with features such as ABS with EBD, body coloured door mirrors, electric ORVMs, chrome accentuated front grille and trunk room lamp.\u000aThe top-end RxL Diesel offers passenger airbag, leather gear shift knob and steering wheel, front fog lamps, roof spoiler with stop lamp, engine start/stop push button, automatic headlamps, remote sensing auto folding ORVMs, smart access key, integrated audio system with CD, MP3, FM, Aux-in, Bluetooth and USB support, 4 speakers and driver seat height adjust.\u000aVerdict\u000a\u000a\u000aWhile it is appreciable that the Renault wants to offer us a hatchback but with a car that looks just like the Micra at a higher price is not acceptable. If the Renault-Nissan Alliance is keen on cross-badging their cars, then we expect something on the lines of Renault Duster and Nissan Terrano. The SUVs can stand on their own even though both are the same cars. We don\u2019t see that happening with the Pulse and Micra.

VIntroduction:Mercedes-Benz is a brand that has stood the test of time. Its vehicles have been well received across the world, and despite growing domestic competition, the company has seen very favourable performance here in India as well. The GLC class is a vehicle that the brand unveiled at the Auto-Expo 2016, and having gotten a glimpse of what the machine was all about, we'd expect any car-lover to count the days down to the model's release. In the meantime, we're here to spill everything we've gathered about the vehicle, and leave you with a sense of eagerness for its release. Pros:1. Muscular exterior format, sure to get heads turning when driving down the road.2. Lavished interiors that very few vehicles could match.Cons:1. Its performance quality could be improved.2. The tall price range is probably its greatest downside.Stand-out Features:1. It comes with a list of very advanced entertainment and comfort features that most people would find mesmerising.2. The presence of strong techno programs such as Electronic stability control and many others get a definite thumbs up from us.Overall:Mercedes-Benz is the type of brand that brings together the best that people could ask for, encapsulating it in the form of a vehicle. The GLC class is an SUV streamlined for a smaller, sportier appearance, and we thought this was brilliant. The exterior modelling was close to perfect, and we found it very hard to flush out flaws in the design. The vehicle has been given a more aesthetic layout with the low and slender shape, and the alluring details. Coming to the interior, we were happy to see just what we expected from this cabin: From the fine wooden inlays to the polished surfaces, we thought that the inner design brims with a sense of eloquence and purity, and the presence of many comfort features only strengthens this. Although the vehicle hasn't been launched yet, we're quite sure of its inner specs, from the engine to the transmission. 2.0-litre engines would power it in both petrol and diesel versions, while many some pretty strong safety shields complete the overall experience and render it flawless. Exteriors:Images of the vehicle on the web leave you with the impression of a well structured, powerful looking vehicle that you don't think twice about loving. We'll admit, the vehicle's robust and masculine stance is nothing like what we've seen in conventional, domestic models. Nevertheless, there are feminine themes that overlap with its strong form, and this is what we thought struck the best look possible. The tall and bulky vehicle has been tailored for a graceful shape, and this brings a modern note in its image. The muscular body lines have been smoothly textured, giving a far more attractive overall delight. It begins drawing viewers in with a face shaped with an aggressive allure, at the focus of which is a large radiator grille.  A thick chrome furnishing stretches across the grille, with the large star-emblem resting at the centre. We know for one that a more distinct image is carved by factors like these, and they ultimate give the vehicle the true grandeur of a Merc. At the bottom, the air intake section is embraced by thick chrome artistry. The headlamp clusters on either side are slim and eye catching, and we thought they complete the picture of the front perfectly. The hood has been refined with subtle lines that we thought made for a more awe-inciting vision. The fine curvatures that run across the bonnet further enhance the look, and there was an overall solidity in the design that we haven't witnessed in any other vehicle of the day. The flawless metallic skin drapes down from the bonnet into the side profile, wrapping over the wheel arches in a neat fashion. There was a more well toned, prominent bearing in the wheel arches that is sure to attract the attention of younger car lovers. When you take a look at the side, you can't help but feel amazed at the serene body lines printed over the door-side. We felt an indomitable spirit of luxury and richness exuded by this set-up, and we'll give the company hats-off for it. The 5-spoke well nurtured alloy wheels are also striking, and the well sculpted design further brings out the best in the vehicle's appearance. As you trace the shape of the vehicle, you find that the rear area has been beefed up nicely, giving a more harmonious exhibition. There was also an element of grace in the structural disposition, so much so much so that the bulky machine almost has the tone of a sports car if viewed from far away. At the rear, the the slender headlamps stretch from the interior of the tail-gate to the side, and we thought there was an inherent, sporty design in them that most people would love. A large chrome strip rests at the bottom of the rear, while the sporty design of the exhaust vents finish the picture off in the cleanest way possible. Interiors:The interiors are large, lavish and comfortable. We've got to tell you, folks, there isn't much that's left behind, and being a Merc, none of its buyers would expect anything less. There is an serene, atmospheric feeling that has been sewn into the place, and it runs over the theme of the car, from the delicate seating to the wood furnished door-sides, the wide dashboard and the eye catching centre console. The powerful ambience has further been strengthened with a host of comfort and convenience features, and all in all, we thought the ride couldn't have gotten any better. At the front, the dashboard has been laid out in a smooth textured, jaw-dropping format, and there is a distinct separation between the glove-box area at the bottom and the top region. The AC vents on either side come with a unique, circular design, and we thought this adds to the in-genuine look of the interior. The upper region of the dashboard has been rests in a higher platform, and when you take a look at this, you can't help but sense a touch of genius in the layout. By the centre of the dash, the large TFT multi-functional display screen gives the entire place a strong, modern look, and we thought this went perfectly with the distinguished aura the vehicle strives to create at every field. The centre console region is adorned with a finely polished wooden surface, and most people would find this irresistible. Three circular AC vents have rest right below the TFT screen, while various control switches are propped below. The centre console slides down in a gentle manner, merging into the adjoining area between the seats. The steering wheel has been moulded with the same, sporty design that conventional vehicles are accustomed to, and the emblem of the brand is perched by the centre for a more distinctive touch. When you take a look at the advanced-looking instrument cluster, you feel the delicacy of the company's design permeate everything within the cabin. The tachometer and the speedometer within come with attractive dials, and both of them are cloaked with large cowls that dish out a pretty impressive statement. Moving away from the dashboard, the doorsides have been lavished the fine wood inlays, and touches of silver within the design make for a more harmonious look. If you ask us, we'd tell you that the seating just can't get any more comfortable. Legroom, headroom and shoulder-room is abundant in both of the rows, while the presence of headrests and armrests adds to the integral experience. The plush leather upholstery brings a far more enriched taste to the ride than any other factor, and we're sure that few people would have a problem there. Performance:The vehicle is based on the C-class, and most of its inner dynamics share a similar platform with the other model. It is supposed to come with engine variants of both petrol and diesel formats. At the petrol front, there is a 2.0-litre trim that levels some decent specs. This includes a power of 211bhp, and a torque of 350Nm. On the diesel end, there is a 2.0-litre engine that comes in two different tuning states. The first pins power and torque values at 170bhp and 400Nm, while the second surpasses this with 204bhp of power and a grinding torque of 500Nm. Both of the mills are expected to come along with a 9G-Tronic automatic gearbox, and we're sure that shifting gears won't get any easier that it does here. Between both the engines, the mileage would vary between 21 to 25kmpl, and with the size and bulk of this machine, this is a figure that is sure to put a smile on many people's faces. Ride and Handling:Most of us would agree that this company just doesn't compromise. Although the vehicle was modelled for and released in markets abroad, you'd be more than justified in imagining a comfortable ride experience here on harsh Indian roads as well. First, strong disc brakes have been clipped onto the front and rear wheels, ensuring that you face no trouble cornering, braking and coming to a quick stop when needed. Aside from this, the chassis arrangement has also been given a robust design on both ends, capable of decimating most road anomalies here. The agility control comfort suspension ensures that most strains you encounter in other vehicles does not hamper your ride here. We haven't gotten the chance to drive the vehicle first hand, but we've drawn inferences from articles circulated online, which point to a rather comfortable, high quality ride that would please most people. The ride stability is further bolstered with some sound techno programs, including the Anti lock braking system, Electronic brake-force distribution, and many more. Safety:You can expect an exhaustive range of safety facilities, seeing as this is a brand that meets very stringent safety standards across the world. It is going to come with ABS and EBD, which together cement safety during the drive by preventing mishaps. Also to be present is an Adaptive brake system, which further boosts the quality of braking. Electronic stability control would help to keep the vehicle in a balanced field when driving, and at the same time, we're sure it eases the burden of handling for the driver as well. Also present would be conventional parameters such as seatbelts, airbags, ISOFIX child seat anchors, a remote boot release system, and perhaps even an electric parking brake. Variants:The vehicle comes in a sole variant, and this makes a fine bonus for many potential buyers. This trim has it all, from exterior cosmetics and comfort to the safety measures and entertainment facilities. The dazzle that you're to expect includes a Burmester surround sound system, a navigation system, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assists, a parking assist, a TCT multi-functional display screen, split folding rear seats, and a massive boot area. Verdict:You can't help but swell with pride as you look at this vehicle live. We'll spell it out bluntly: this is a vehicle that comes with a lot of advantages, and very few disappointments. It has a thrilling look, vibrantly modelled interiors, an over-flowing list of features, many handling aids and decent performance. However, be aware that this is also a rather expensive piece, and something that you might trade for a less priced model if you can compromise on luxury slightly. At the end of the day, this is a vehicle tailored for those with a fat wallet and a desire for the best. For those who just require a modest vehicle that can get the job done, we'd recommend some other model in a completely different range.

With conventional car makers comfortably settled in less perky areas, the burden of shaping the luxury segment of the vehicle falls on a unique line of brands such as Mercedes-Benz. The GLE 450 AMG Coupe is probably one of the more daring releases for the market, with tough competition from the likes of Audi and BMW. With its own unique niche of designing, the car has borne the brunt of competition in all other countries it has been released in, keeping itself afloat and well ahead. We at Cardekho delve into the many facets of the vehicle to find out exactly where it derives its powerful allure from.Background and Evolution:Originally born more than two decades ago, this model series has a longer history. The model was released in the United States in the year 1997, initially borne with the name, 'M-Class'. In 2001, the vehicle received a facelift, with many significant changes for its exterior including revised front and rear bumpers, new alloy wheels and new headlamp lenses. In 2005, the second generation of the model came out, and it boasted impressive new features such as a 7G-Tronic gearbox, Bi-Xenon headlamps and an adjustable air based suspension. The current version in market was unveiled in 2011, and it came with a slew of modern features such as an adaptive cruise control, an active curve system and anti roll bars to support the suspension.Exteriors:The SUV comes with a husky format that has not been seen among SUVs from major Indian manufacturers. Its majestic demeanour would overshadow any other vehicle, while at the same time, imbibing some serious class into its menacing stature. Standing before the vehicle, we were given a first imprint of awe at its powerful position, but the enriched design scheme takes this quite a bit further.Personally, we found the look of the Coupe variant to be a more enthralling one, and if you're out there for looks over utility, then the dashy appearance of the Coupe is sure to cage your attraction. The gracefully descended rear end and the overall streamlined shape, this variant evokes the more racy flavour in the model series, and is sure to thrill its own niche of customers.Some of the design elements shared between all variants were also worth the exterior gamble. Posted at the front is a wide radiator grille, with two sculpted louvres around the Mercedes star for a more emboldened effect.The headlamp clusters on either side host a variety of lighting units, including LEDs and turn indicators.\u000aThe accentuated front bumper with its chrome inserts renders a more splendid appeal. This goes in harmony with the under-body protection, which comes with a chrome look finish. The wide hood is glazed with well tendered lines, and in our taste, this perfected the vision of the car's front, balancing its masculine bearing with a more gentle and feminine touch.Stretching over the side of the vehicle is a chrome beltline strip, which imparts a more lavish design to the side profile. There are other subtle lines that breeze through the side of the vehicle, and although they are eclipsed by more prominent features, you're sure to catch a glimpse of them with time.The light alloy wheels add an element of sportiness to the car, and this is further emphasised by the wide and prominent wheel arches.The company goes out of the way to stress the uniqueness of the machine, with aluminium running boards and roof rails that are sure to bring a more energetic effect to the build. We won't lie on the account that the robust make of the vehicle leaves areas of its appeal suffering, but its well balanced structure redeems some of the beauty. The well toned effect at the rear is sure to get your attention, for this gives the entire vehicle a well oriented position.\u000aThe brand undeniably goes out of the way to display its love for chrome, with a rear sill protector in chrome and tailpipes plated with chrome. If you're the race-loving type, the well integrated roof spoiler is sure to get your attention, while the sporty twin-pipe exhausts cements the vehicle\u2019s all flavoured build.Personally, we found the look of the Coupe variant to be a more enthralling one, and if you're out there for looks over utility, then the dashy appearance of the Coupe is sure to cage your attraction. The gracefully descended rear end and the overall streamlined shape, this variant evokes the more racy flavour in the model series, and is sure to thrill its own niche of customers. Observers would be quick to note its well balanced dimensions, with a length of 4819mm, a width of 2141mm and height of 1796mm.A boot space of 690-litres is all too good for even the most avid camper, and this figure towers well before most other competitors in the space.\u000a\u000aInteriors:The spacious and fulfilling layout of the cabin is sure to take you by surprise. But more than this, it is the more sensual nature of the build that would garner approval. It is needless to say that this brand has captivated the most luxurious interior arrangement in any model rolled out by them, and this vehicle stays true to this ideal.The Coupe's cabin may deter those looking for space and luxury, but what it lacks in space, it makes up abundantly in style. The sportily designed steering wheel has been posted with the brand emblem at the centre. The instrument panel has been positioned within arm's reach, along with the gear shifter and other elements. We found this to reduce the burden quite a bit. The instrument dials have been hosted strategically behind the steering wheel, and this is also a bonus for the man behind the wheel.Moving on to the existing variants, the front panel, the wide seats, the centre console, the door-sides and the steering wheel are positioned for a picture of harmony and elegance.Perhaps the most accomplished artistry that you'd ask for lies in the seats. Besides being comfortable and ergonomically designed, the seats are dressed in ARTICO black leather that is man-made, giving the customer a rarely found human touch to the insides of a machine. We feel that that the presence of headrests and armrests adds to the delight of the experience.Headlining is present in crystal grey fabric as well as porcelain fabric, and this interacts with the rest of the car's design to form a more vibrant atmosphere altogether.If you're the type that enjoys inlays of wood, this car provides more than you could ask for, with high quality brown wood furnishing areas of the cabin.Most of us would agree that the most striking element of design on the inside of this car would be the door sill panels that come along with the 'Mercedes-Benz' lettering, carving a more distinguished effect for this cabin. Seating on the other hand, is far more comfortable and makes for a quality ride.This vehicle is among the league of luxury vehicle with top-notch fit and finish. It would not fail to impress you in this regard owing to attention-to-detail opted by Mercedes. The floor console is mounted with control switches of drive modes and a touch controller that adds to the convenience quotient.Performance:\u000a\u000a Diesel:Propulsion power is delivered from a mighty 3.0-litre V6 engine which displaces 2987cc. This plant scores pretty well with respect to specifications, holding a power of 258bhp at 3400rpm, along with a torque of 620Nm at 1600rpm. The top speed is 225kmph, which is more than you could ask for in a vehicle of this size. Drivability on city roads is far more superior and on open roads, it offers the real fun of driving. You won\u2019t notice any form of vibration or any sound disturbance from the engine.The brand is offering another diesel engine as well, an in-line 4-cylinder 2143cc plant, which unleashes 204bhp at 3800rpm and a torque of 500Nm at 1600rpm to 1800rpm. We've got to tell you that these are pretty sharp figures when placed against competitors in the segment, although there are many SUVs, which could far outperform this one. We found no disturbances with the running of the engine, but some might be quick to notice a very mild hum from the engine. The driver would relish the experience with a 9G-Tronic automatic transmission that helps to relieve a lot of the drive strain and bring a more enjoyable experience.Petrol EngineThe newly launched GLE 450 AMG Coupe is powered by a 3.0-litre V-Type petrol mill, which is capable of unleashing 367bhp in combination with a torque of 520Nm. We at CarDekho expect this to be of reasonable performance, especially considering the figures unearthed. Although it lags behind some other competitors, most people looking for a balance between luxury and power would be more than happy with it, considering that an acceleration rate of 5.7 seconds is more than a loud figure for an SUV.Ride and Handling:This company may not have experienced Indian roads first hand, but its overall design sophistication seems to be adept at tackling these conditions. We were more than happy with the alignment, balance and overall stability of the drive, and we'll assure you this might strike you as quite an achievement considering the vehicle's husky mass. The company has equipped the vehicle with strong steel springs to absorb any road strains. A selective damping system also plays a major role in securing ride comfort, with the ability to re-adapt itself according to the drive situation. Any lay-dweller would be impressed with the company's sophisticated build diagram. While most other manufacturers stop with a strong chassis alignment and good brakes, here is a company that has taken the liberty of programming many efficient aid programs to greatly bolster safety for the occupants. Among these is the anti lock braking system, the electronic stability program, as well as a downhill speed regulation facility. An extraordinary ease of handling is granted by the direct-steer system, which boosts response and provides assistance during demanding situation. All of this interacts to shape a truly stress-free drive experience for anyone, although rare bumps and jerks are to be expected.Safety:The factor that impressed us more than anything else was the vehicle's safety arrangements. There were conventional features such as airbags, 3-point seatbelts, childproof doors and seatbelt warning signals. Aside from these, this vehicle boasts many out of the box unconventional features that would surprise many as well. This includes the acceleration skid control program, the brake assist that comes along with brake servo assistance, a crosswind assistance and a seat occupancy recognition for the front passenger.Variants:\u000a\u000aVerdict:\u000aThis is a vehicle that has a very clear positive verdict, with its enthralling design, its expensive interiors, its powerful engine and a range of rarely seen before comfort features. But you've got to take into accord its phenomenal price tag, something that would alone, make up for much of the plush points. At the end of the day, this is a car that represents the very cream of the cake, so if you're the type that will shell out as much as possible to have the perfect ride, this is the model you should go for.

VIntroductionHyundai Grand i10 was the first car to get the Fluidic Design concept from the company and the car received an amazing response for its pleasing design and a long list of features, some of which are segment firsts. Not just in India, the new Grand i10 or just i10 as known globally has found fans all around the globe. With compact dimensions, spacious interiors, class leading features and frugal engines, it\u2019s no wonder that the Hyundai Grand i10 won the 2014 Indian Car of the Year Award.Pros1. Fresh and neat design; will please most and hurt none.\u000a\u000a2. Segment leading features such as rear AC vents, push button start/stop, keyless entry, chilled glove box.\u000a\u000a3. India-spec Grand i10 is longer in length and wheelbase than the Euro-spec, resulting in airy cabin and space.\u000a\u000a4. Conventional handling, comfortable ride quality. Well tuned for Indian roads.Cons1. ABS and Airbags available only in the Top variant as an option.\u000a\u000a2. Non-adjustable front head rests.Stand-out features1. First-in-segment rear AC vents.\u000a\u000a2. Best-in-class build quality.ExteriorHyundai Grand i10 was the first car to introduce the brand\u2019s Fluidic Design concept to the customers in India. The front gets most of the design\u2019s impact with swept back headlamps, hexagonal grille and a pronounced bumper that hosts a nicely designed fog lamps.To the side, things are kept simple with a sharp crease runs the length of the car, joining the door handles on to the tail lamp.The side profile of the Indian Grand i10 has a few changes in comparison to its Euro version. The car is longer by 100 mm in length and has a 40 mm longer wheelbase in the Indian avatar. The rear door and rear windows are larger and with a redesigned C-pillar, making for a spacious rear cabin. A waistline black molding adds safety from scratches apart from the style appeal. The eight spoke alloy wheels look great with the diamond cut finish.To the rear, things are kept simple yet not boring. The wrap-around tail lamps are nicely designed while the rear bumper integrated reflectors add a touch of style and safety.Dimension wise, the Grand i10 may not be as long or as wide as its competitors. The Grand i10 also has the shortest wheelbase with 2425 mm. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the Grand i10 is not spacious. In fact, the rear seat of the Grand is one of the most spacious in its segment.The Grand i10 also offers one of the spacious boots in its class with 256 litres. Only the new Ford Figo offers better boot space at 257 litres while Toyota Liva gets close at 251 litres.InteriorsThe Grand i10\u2019s interiors are the best in class in terms of build quality and finish. The quality of the materials used and the way the parts are put together rival the some of the cars in the C segment.Along with a contemporary styling, the black and beige interiors offer amazing quality of materials and a functional layout.While the top and bottom of the interiors get the black layout, the middle gets the beige treatment. All the buttons are of good size and are placed in comfortable positions for use. The front seats snuggle you up nicely with the right amount of cushioning and offer nice thigh support and leg room. While the driver seat height adjustment is a welcome addition, the fixed headrests are a missed opportunity.The steering wheel gets a nice size to hold onto and can be adjusted for tilt but not for reach. The instrument cluster is not your regular two pod layout. Instead you get a big speedometer in the middle with a half-moon tacho to the left and two dials for engine temperature and fuel level to the right. There is also a multi-information display below showing the odometer, two trip meters and gear shift indicator. The steering wheel gets controls for music and telephone.The centre console is a neatly designed arrangement the top of the console hosting the entertainment system with two circular AC vents to either side. The bottom half of the console gets the AC controls with the regular three dial layout. The glove box is large and you can keep your things cool inside the glove box, keeping them fresh away from the heat.At the rear, things further gets better with the first-in-segment rear AC vents, bettering the job of cooling down the cabin faster. The additional 100 mm of length and 40 mm of longer wheelbase that we talked about earlier makes its usefulness in the rear seat space. Three adults can travel in reasonable comfort thanks to lots of legroom and the shoulder room is also commendable. The rear seats can be folded down for additional luggage space but they are not 60-40 split.As with all the Hyundais, the Grand i10 too gets a long list of features with several segment leading ones.The features include rear AC vents, push button start/stop, keyless entry, cooled glove box etc.Surprisingly, climate control is not available and the rear defogger is only available from the Sportz variant.PerformanceThe Grand i10 is available in two engine options - the tried and tested 1.2-litre Kappa Dual VTVT petrol engine and the new 1.1-litre 2nd Gen U2 diesel engine.PetrolThe Grand i10 petrol is powered by a 1.2-litre Kappa Dual VTVT engine putting out 82 bhp at 6000 rpm and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4000 rpm. You get a choice of either a 5-speed manual gearbox or a 4-speed automatic one. The petrol unit is the proven one already powering the regular i10 among others. The engine feels super refined at idle and even when revved to some extent. It\u2019s only when you get closer to red lining it, the engine gets vocal. The engine responses eagerly and has a healthy mid range.On the highways, the unit doesn\u2019t feel lazy and overtaking is done neatly with just a downshift. The 1.2-litre petrol engine is a rev happy unit and the torque that starts to deliver at low rpms does a good job for city driving. The 5-speed manual does a neat job of slotting gears smoothly.DieselThe new 1.1-litre 2nd Gen U2 diesel engine makes its debut with the Grand i10. The 1.1-litre makes a maximum power of 70 bhp at 4000 rpm and a peak torque of 160 Nm at 1500-2750 rpm. The 3-cylinder may be weaker than most of its competition but its lighter weight should compensate for the performance.  The power delivery is linear and there is no surging like the normal turbo units. The turbo lag is kept to the minimum and the engine pulls off easily from idle.But bring the car to the highways and you will be left wanting for more. The U2 unit loses the fizz very soon close to 3700 rpm and post that, there is no use in revving it up. Overtaking should be planned carefully and if you lose speed, gaining it back will take time. The Grand i10 diesel is well refined from inside the cabin and the gearbox is smooth.Ride and HandlingThe Grand i10 gets a McPherson Strut to the front and coupled torsion beam axle to the rear for its suspension setup. Focus has been largely on the riding comfort more than handling and this shows in the Grand i10 soaking up the bumps with a slight thud. Straight line ability for high speeds is good but around the curves and bends, you will feel the body roll more than you will like.\u000a\u000aBut for most of the part, the Grand i10 handles neutrally without any surprises and without any fun either. The handling of the car is predictable and may put off enthusiasts (who will go for the Swift or the new Figo). The masses will like the ride quality and that will be the USP to take from the Grand i10. The braking duties are performed without any drama once you get used to the sharper bite.SafetyThough the Euro spec Grand i10 gets six airbags, the Indian Grand gets only dual airbags in the front and ABS too but only in the Asta variant as an option. Then there is the rear defogger and reverse parking sensors that is available from the Sportz variant. Other safety features include immobilizer, front fog lamps, day and night inside rear view mirror and central locking.VariantsThe Hyundai Grand i10 is available in five variants for both petrol and diesel versions. The 4-speed automatic version is only available in the Asta variant.The base Era variant gets Engine immobilizer, chrome radiator grille, 2-tone black and beige interior, front and rear door map pockets, tachometer, MID, power steering, manual AC with heater, front power windows, internally adjustable ORVMs.Next in line is the Magna variant which will be one of the best selling variants as it offers most useful features. The Magna gets Central locking, front fog lamps, day and night inside rearview mirror, standard keyless entry, body coloured door mirrors and door handles, full wheel covers, rear power windows, electrically adjustable ORVMs and rear AC vents.The Sportz variant adds Reverse parking sensors, rear defogger, roof rails, turn indicators on ORVMs, metal finish inside door handles, 2-DIN integrated system with Radio, CD, MP3, Aux-in, Bluetooth connectivity, steering wheel controls, electric folding ORVMs and tilt steering.The top end Asta gets Smart key, chrome outside door handles, rear spoiler, clean silver alloy wheels, leather wrapped steering wheel, rear washer and wiper, push button start/stop, driver seat height adjust and adjustable rear seat headrests.If you want to driver and front passenger airbags, ABS and diamond cut alloy wheels, you have to opt for Asta (O).VerdictThe Grand i10 just reiterates how long has Hyundai come to offer better looking cars that offer good driving experience and lots of features.This equation has been unmatched by many manufacturers and there lies Hyundai\u2019s success formula.

VMaruti India has always been the common man's best friend in the Indian automobile industry, when it comes to reaching out with great cars that can be afforded by all sections of the community. Another great attempt made by the company is to create a unique combination of getting all the possible comforts in a hatchback, which has been successfully achieved and is identified as the \u000aMaruti Ritz\u000a model series. All the descriptions fall short to measure the goodness this hatchback possesses. The insides capture one's heart in just one peep into it. It has been fitted with stylish seats, which are stitched into with a premium dual tone color scheme that look stunning and diversely attractive. It has a new front design that gives it a unique style and it does stand out for its look, defeating other offerings in its category. The safety quotient has been designed in such a way that the entire mechanism is in the control of its driver. The efficient braking mechanism that is incorporated in this hatchback is to team up both the anti lock braking system along with electronic brake force distribution and help in providing great control to the driver over the vehicle. The new premium SRS airbags are expected to protect the driver and the co-driver against any possible collision to the steering wheel or the windows. When it comes to the convenience, it is built to give great flexibility in almost all the elements possible. The 236 litre boot space has the possibility to increase further by the 60:40 split rear seat, which allows you to fold it and and facilitates more luggage in it. It has got a new multi information display that has multiple notifications that are incorporated into this hatchback. There is a new audio system with USB interface available to it along with four speakers. The standard features too make their way in dressing up this hatch in a different style to show up at varied palces in this much appreciated vehicle. One amongst them is that even the day and night rear view mirror has got a great new look that flaunts itself in the center of the cabin in a chrome based finishing to its housing. The comfort levels are heightened by the features like fitting the audio controls to the steering wheel that is a great convenience to the driver. Additionally, the keyless entry too helps in keeping up the safety standards. The intelligent spaces that are incorporated in this hatchback add to the storage capacity offered in this hatchback. And last but not the least, it has got an impressive 23.2 Kmpl mileage by the diesel versions, which turns out to be a boon to the daily travellers. It also has a standard warranty, which can be further increased under the extended warranty schemes that are available at the authorized dealers.The entire structure is built targeting to accommodate tall persons which is addressed by the company as a unique tall boy design. The mouldings on the side profile protects the car from any external intrusion from besides. The body colored outside door handles mix in well with the overall decal. There are outside rear view mirrors that can be electrically adjustable . Both the sides of the door mirrors can be manually remote controlled. Then there is a headlamp in the front which has a multi reflector. There is an antenna fitted on the roof. A defogger function is built into the rear windscreen which is useful in foggy climate conditions. Additionally, a wiper as well as washer too are fitted to the rear glass. There is a spoiler at the rear end that lifts up the look from the back. The top end variant looks stylish and modern for having been given alloy wheels.\u000a \u000a \u000aExterior Measurements:\u000a \u000a \u000a It has an overall length of 3775mm, width of 1680mm and stands high at 1620mm. The wheelbase is of 2360mm which is good enough and a ground clearance of 170mm. It has a good turning radius of 4.7 meters.Ed's Take:\u000a  Ritz is based on the platform of the old Swift, but being a tall boy there is sufficient space on the inside. The fit and finish of the plastic is also decent and the bells and whistles on the offering are good. There isn't much to complain about the Ritz, except the fact that it now looks aged when compared to competition\u000a The 60:40 split rear seats make way for more luggage to accommodate into the boot compartment. The driver side seat can be height adjustable as per personal preference of the driver. The driver as well as the co-driver seats have got back pockets attached to it. The front seat of the co-driver side is given an under tray to it. The rear seats as well as the front seats are fitted with head restraints. It is integrated with an audio unit that has a radio tuner, a CD and USB support as well which are complimented by four speakers. The standard day and night inside rear view mirror has a housing that is in chrome. There are light off, key off, seat belt reminders and door closure warning lamp as well. Whereas the multi information display has other notifications such as fuel consumption and a tachometer. The instrument panel on the driver side as well as the passenger side is attached with pockets that are integrated to the dashboard and would accommodate ample stuff to fill it with. And then, the cup holders in the console and the glove box too increase the capacity of storage in this car. All these interior elements are themed in two-tone inside color combination of either dark grey and light grey or dark grey and red, depending upon the variants.\u000a \u000a \u000aInterior Comfort:\u000a \u000a \u000a This hatchback is well equipped with features that make this a vehicle a perfect comfort commodity to own. The foremost comfort element is to have reverse parking sensors assisted with a digital display and sound alerts as well. Then there is an air conditioning unit with the vents placed well in the cabin to regulate the temperature. Further, we have a music system of which the audio controls are mounted on the steering wheel, and in the top end trims, it supports the CD player, speakers and radio tuner as well. And the comfortable couch like seating is integrated with adjustable head restraints as well as height adjustment facility for the driver seat in the high end variants. Back pockets to the front seat, an under tray, cup holders in the console, a glove box and a door pocket to the front doors contribute to its storage capacity. Additionally, there is an accessory socket available to charge the gadgets on driver. There is a keyless entry and a day and night inside rear view mirror fitted as a standard feature. The sun visors on both the driver and the passenger side are affixed with vanity mirrors.\u000a \u000a Interior Measurements:\u000a \u000a \u000a It has a fuel tank capacity of 43 litres. The boot space is quite good with 236 litres potential and by folding the rear seating, it can be increased further. Boasting a unique tall boy design, it facilitates the taller passengers conveniently with great headroom and it has a spacious cabin that accommodates fiver persons comfortably.Ed's Take:\u000a   The acceleration of the Ritz is good for a hatchback. It does well in terms of outright performance as both the engines are peppy. \u000a This hatchback has the potential to race to a top speed of 175 Kmph and can accelerate to a 100 Kmph mark in about 13.3 seconds from a scratch. Whereas the diesel variant has an engine that can reach 155 Kmph speed on the tops and does accelerate from zero to 100 Kmph in just around 14.2 seconds.Ed's Take:\u000a  Both the engines on the Ritz are good and picking amongst both won't be a bad decision. Hence, choose the engine as per your usage.  The diesel has better mileage.\u000a This car is offered in both diesel as well as petrol versions and are in compliance with the BS-IV emission norms. It is integrated with a 1.3 litre diesel mill that has four cylinders and a total of sixteen valves that displaces 1248cc. This motor generates a maximum power of 73.97bhp at 4000rpm and produces a maximum torque output of 190Nm at 2000rpm. The 1.2 litre K- series petrol motor too has four cylinders and sixteen valves which can displace 1197cc. This mill can generate a maximum power of 85.80bhp at 6000rpm and has a potential to deliver a maximum torque output of 114Nm at 4000rpm.Ed's Take:\u000a  Fuel efficiency will not be a let down factor as this gets the same DDiS engine, which is known as the multijet. Some drivability improvements have been made on the Ritz.\u000a  With an integrated multi point fuel injection system, its petrol mill can squeeze approximately 18.5 Kmpl on the highways and 14.7 Kmpl in the city. The automatic version gives a 17.16 Kmpl on the bigger roads, whereas in the city, it is only 13 Kmpl. Its diesel version is fitted with a common rail direct injection fuel supply system that lets it to deliver a maximum mileage of 23.2 Kmpl on bigger roads and 18.6 Kmpl in the city conditions.Ed's Take:\u000a  The drivability on both is good, and even the gearbox is slick. The gearing is also good for linear power delivery.\u000a The petrol variants can generate a maximum power of 85.80bhp at 6000rpm, while it produces a torque output of 114Nm at 4000rpm. And then the maximum power produced by the diesel motor is 73.97bhp at 4000rpm and gives out a peak torque output of 190Nm at 2000rpm.Ed's Take:\u000a  The Ritz petrol gets in-dash music system, steering mounted audio, while the diesel comes like a plain vanilla ice cream till the VDi. The ZDi now gets all the features that one wants to see in a Ritz, just like the Ritz ZXi.\u000a  An advanced music system has been integrated to this vehicle, which includes an audio system with a USB support to it. The audio controls have been mounted on the steering wheel which gives easy regulation of the players. The audio system supports the CD and has got a radio facility to it as well. There are a set of four speakers that are installed into the cabin of which two are at the front and the other two are at the rear cabin. The accessories that can be additionally installed into this vehicle are elements like tweeter, woofers and amplifiers to the entertainment section. Furthermore, into the variants which do not have Bluetooth, it can be incorporated as well. For protection from the sun, door visors can be added and for protection from the wet roads, mud guards could be fitted as well.Ed's Take:\u000a  The Ritz being softly sprung, its ride is well compliant. The handling might just not impress you too much, as there is some amount of body roll. The Ritz isn't made for driving enthusiasts.\u000a  The safety quotient is addressed well with a perfect combination of an anti lock braking system teaming with the electronic brake force distribution. This braking mechanism ensures in a safe and controlled drive. Ventilated disc brakes are affixed to the front and rear wheels as well, whereas the rear ones are fitted with drum brakes. The suspension consists of a McPherson strut to its front axle and a torsion beam with coil springs is to its rear axle. The power assisted steering system that is tilt adjustable is decked into this car. It has a good minimum turning radius of 4.7 meters.Ed's Take:\u000a  The Ritz petrol comes with two airbags and ABS, while the diesel gets only ABS as an optional and there is no airbags option in the diesel.\u000a  The most very proficiently by the company in manufacturing this automobile commodity, the car, by incorporating it with elements like child safety lock system, which denies any unauthorized exit. It further consists of a smart computerized anti theft system which is called iCATS, protects the vehicle from any possible theft. The passenger protection at the rear is ensured with a three point emergency locking retractor as well as a lap belt. Whereas, the seat belts in the front are shoulder adjustable. The most important factor that stands as a wall between this car and all possible risks is a robust braking mechanism of anti lock braking system and an electronic brake force distribution. In the high end variants, air bags of supplemental restraint system are provided for the driver as well as the co-passenger. The high mounted stop lamp works in letting the other vehicles notice the presence of this car from quite far. The dual horn gives additional impact to the sound it produces. The door closure warning lamp as well as the driver seat belt reminder is offered too.A set of 14 inch alloy wheels that are covered with 185/70 R14 sized radial tubeless tyres are fitted to the top end trims. While the entry and mid level variants are equipped with 14 inch steel wheels that have tubeless radial tyres of size 165/80 R14 covered over them. Furthermore, a spare wheel along with other necessary tools are provided in the boot compartment as well.1. The look is quite appealing.\u000a \u000a 2. Mileage of the diesel variant is good.\u000a \u000a 3. Cabin is spacious.\u000a \u000a 4. Efficient braking mechanism.\u000a \u000a 5. Loaded with comfort features.1. Safety needs to be addressed in a better way.\u000a \u000a 2. Only few comfort elements are offered.\u000a \u000a 3. Fuel economy of the automatic version is not good enough.\u000a \u000a 4. The price range is not reasonable.\u000a \u000a 5. Boot space is quite less.

VAfter introducing the Abarth 500 model, Fiat India has now rolled two more products in the country powered by Abarth. One of these is the much hyped \u000aFiat Punto Abarth\u000a , which is a hatchback. It is based on the same platform on which, the Punto Evo is designed. This version draws power from the 1.4-litre T-Jet petrol engine, which is also under the hood of its Linea sedan. However, the firm has attuned this power plant to increase its output to 145bhp, which is insane for 1368cc mill. This helps the vehicle to travel 1 kilometer in just 30.4 seconds only. This is perhaps the only engine option that the company is offering for now. It looks pretty much alike the existing hatchback model, but the exclusive cosmetic package distinguishes it from the rest. Even after having the brand Abarth characteristics, it has been introduced at a very competitive price tag enabling it to give tough times for the likes of Volkswagen Polo GT TSI. There is no wonder if this powerful hatchback gains the upper hand over the others, since it has everything to meet the requirements of power-starved enthusiasts in India. This is perhaps the first car in the sub 10-lakh segment to have disc braking mechanism for all wheels, which balances its immense power capabilities.\u000a \u000a As we can see through the images, there are quite a few cosmetic add-ons given to its exteriors like body decals and signature alloy wheels and other sporty features. The interiors are in black color scheme highlighted by ambient lighting scheme on the dashboard. Adding to this, the analogue gauges have red dials that further emphasizes its sporty aura. As for the features, this model gets all the facilities and equipment borrowed from Punto EVO hatchback along with a few other add-ons. To start with the safety department, it has a reinforced body structure with impact protection mechanism for ensuring occupants safety. Besides all this, there are features like airbags with early crash sensors, ABS with EBD, fire prevention system, 3-point seatbelts, central locking, immobilizer and other major protective functions. This version also gets comfort facilities like an automatic air conditioning unit, height adjustable driver's seat, power windows, electrically adjustable ORVMs and numerous other functions. As for the cabin space, this hatchback is designed to accommodate a total of five passengers. The seats inside have an ergonomic design, which is essential for experiencing comfort while driving. We can also see that there is a multi-functional steering wheel wrapped in leather and is affixed with 'Abarth' insignia. Moving on to the entertainment section, there is an integrated CD/MP3 player along with an FM radio. Accompanied with these are the connectivity features like Bluetooth, USB and AUX-In which enhances the conveniences inside.There are several plus points about this vehicle and its external styling is certainly its key highlight. Although, it looks to be the same like its sibling hatchback, its brand Abarth's cosmetic package is what renders it a outstanding look. Currently, this hatchback is available in black and white exterior paint options. Additionally, its body is decorated with red colored decals that enhances its dynamic appeal. This is indeed a perfect color combination for any vehicle in the sports arena. To begin with the side profile, its door panels have these decals in the lower section with Abarth lettering on it. Here, the door handles are painted in body color, while outside rear view mirrors are in dual color (red and black). They are also integrated with side turn indicator for added elegance and safety. The neatly crafted wheel arches are mated to a set of signature alloy wheels, which have 'Abarth' emblem on them. Moving on to its rear end, it looks pretty attractive owing to its distinctive set of taillights. They have LED look alike brake lights, which amplifies this facet. The rear bumper is in body color with a pair of reflectors. Additionally, there are chrome accents surrounding these reflectors, enhancing its perfect build. This hatchback looks much aggressive from its front facade, thanks to its bold headlight cluster, which houses powerful lamps along with turn blinkers. The radiator grille in the center is has a thick chrome surround. Furthermore, there are red accents on the strips inside this grille that flaunts a sporty silhouette. The bumper below has a smaller air intake section, but the fog lamp console are big and has a thick metallic surround. Its overall look is complimented by the 'Abarth' logo, which is positioned on top of the hood.\u000a \u000a \u000aExterior Measurements:\u000a \u000a \u000a As expected, this hatchback is introduced in the sub 4-meter segment with a total length measuring 3989mm. It has a width of 1687mm and a total height of about 1505mm. Its minimum ground clearance is just about 155mm. However, the overall wheelbase of this hatchback is 2510mm, which is good enough for having comfortable cabin space.This \u201chottest hatch\u201d of India (as stated by the company), can certainly impress customers with its attractive interiors. The manufacturer has chosen a sporty all black color scheme for its insides. Furthermore, there is an ambient lighting given on the dashboard that compliments well with the insides. Its cockpit has a contemporary design featuring metallic finish in few areas that brings a rich appeal. There is a three spoke steering wheel, which has tilt adjustment facility. Also, it is wrapped with a fine quality leather and have a few switches mounted on it. The 'Abarth' instrument cluster is one of its highlights and design of its center console also matches with the entire setup.

What makes it look different from others is the combination of contrasting red and yellow stitching on the seat covers. Aluminum foot pedals, inside rear view mirror, accessory socket and power operated windows are some of the utilities.\u000a \u000a \u000aInterior Comfort:\u000a \u000a \u000a This brand has always taken care about the passenger comfort in all its models, and this one is no exception. One of the main facility that it comes with is the fully automatic climate control unit featuring a foot level air circulating vents for rear. This helps to spread the air evenly in the entire cabin to make a pleasant environment inside. Also, there might be an integrated audio system that lets its occupants to enjoy their favorite music whenever required. The speed sensing volume controls are also provided inside for added convenience. Not to forget that the seats can provide enhanced comfort and support all through the journey. Moreover, the driver's seat also has height adjustment facility and lumbar support too. One of the main facility inside the cabin is the advanced instrument cluster with a few functions included.

Furthermore, the aspects such as electric boot release, large glove box compartment, tilt adjustable steering wheel and electrically adjustable outside mirrors assist in improving the comfort levels to a great extent.\u000a \u000a \u000aInterior Measurements:\u000a \u000a \u000a The dimensions seem to be just perfect with ample head and shoulder room. The leg space too looks very sufficient. The boot volume is also good and the rear seat aids in making more room for luggage.After going through its power figures, we can expect that this vehicle to be good at acceleration. The manufacturer claims that the vehicle can accelerate from 0 to 100 Kmph mark in mere 8.8 seconds and can travel from 0 to 1 kilometer in just 30.4 seconds only. As for maximum speed, it can clock about 180 to 190 Kmph.As we expected earlier, this latest hatchback has arrived with a 1.4-litre, T-Jet petrol engine fitted under its bonnet. This is a turbocharged motor, which is coupled with a 5-speed manual transmission gear box that distributes power to its front wheels. This drive train comprises of 4-cylinders and 16-valves altogether making a total displacement capacity of 1368cc. It is also incorporated with a multi point fuel injection system for optimum power output and performance. It has the ability to churn out a maximum power of 145bhp at 5500rpm and yields a peak torque output of 212Nm between 2000 to 4000rpm. This mill is claimed to return a fuel economy of about 16.13 Kmpl.This sensational product draws the power from a 1.4-litre T-Jet petrol engine, whose capabilities are boosted to improve power output. However, this doesn't seem to have affected its fuel efficiency, as it is claimed to give a mileage of approximately 16.3 Kmpl (as per ARAI).Like mentioned above, the Italian automobile firm has tuned this 1368cc power plant enabling it to generate more power. As a result of this, it is able to churn out 145bhp of maximum power along with 212Nm of hammering torque.Packed with this powerful hatchback is a sophisticated in-car entertainment that comprises of various equipment. To start with, there is a CD/MP3 player along with an AM/FM radio tuner. Besides, there are USB and auxiliary input options, which provides added convenience to the occupants. It also has Bluetooth connectivity for music streaming and voice connection. It also features an SMS readout facility as well as speed sensing volume controls. Aside from these, the controls for audio system have been placed on the steering wheel, which makes it easy to operate the audio system.Compared to the existing Punto EVO hatch, this latest model might have a lowered suspension, which eventually improves its handling characteristics. As for the front axle, there is an independent wheel type of suspension accompanied with torsion beam suspension at the rear. Both the axles are further loaded with helical coil springs and double acting telescopic dampers and stabilizer bars for making the drive jerk-free. As for the braking, all the four wheels have been assembled with a robust set of disc brakes, which are necessary for this powerful hatch. This mechanism is assisted by the anti lock braking system and electronic brake force distribution, which makes cornering stress-free and more safe. Also, it has a hydraulic power assisted steering column that is good at offering response, depending upon the speed level.This Italian automaker seems to have packed this stunner with some crucial safety function to guarantee a secure ride to its passengers. One of those features are the dual front airbags with early crash sensors, which takes the safety to the next level. It also has the ABS along with EBD, which is important for this kind of a hatchback. Its engine immobilizer with rolling code is also integrated to this vehicle that helps to prevent any kind of unauthorized access. Not to forget, it has a robust body structure with impact protection beams and crumple zones to reduce the risk of injury. The instrument panel too aids in alerting the driver by giving out necessary updates likes seat belt warning light and programmable speed limit buzzer. A few other such safety features are also provided inside like 3-point seat belts, automatic door locks, high mount stop lamp, front passenger airbag deactivation, central door locking, fire prevention system and height adjustable front seatbelts.This latest Punto Abarth has a breathtaking appearance, thanks to its modish set of alloy wheels. These rims are of size 16 inches and in a Scorpion sting design. High performance tubeless tyres of size 195/55 R16 have been adorned to them to ensure a smooth and comfortable driving experience.1.

VIntroductionThe blue oval has had it\u2019s share of hits and misses in the country. While vehicles like the Ikon and the Fiesta were runaway hits, certain models like the Mondeo or the updated Fiesta simply failed to make an impression on Indian consumers.  2015 was an extremely good year for Ford India. The Figo twins and the updated EcoSport are currently leading Ford\u2019s arsenal for the Indian market.However, their claim to fame in India, their piece de resistance, something that helped Ford be an established name in the market was lurking in the shadows and eventually forgotten. However, Ford has now launched an all-new generation of the much loved Endeavour. Can it add to Ford\u2019s revival or be the heaviest anchor in their portfolio? Let\u2019s find out!Pros1. Space. Proper big car that can accommodate 7 adults.2. Build quality. Feels solid and upmarket inside out. A trait that the current Fortuner skimps on.3. Expansive feature list: Panoramic Sunroof, Terrain Management System, Leather Upholstery, electric tail-gate release etc.Cons1. 6-Speed Autobox is lazy to respond to inputs.2. No manual transmission available with the 3.2 litre engine3. Top-spec 2.2 litre version misses out on many features like the sunroof, electrically folding seats etc.Stand Out Features1. Terrain management system. Can choose between Snow, Mud & Grass, Sand and Rock modes for traction across various terrain.2. Programmable second key is a segment first. Can limit audio volume and set a top speed limit.OverviewIn an era where most SUV manufacturers are making their humble giants shed weight, the Endeavour remains as butch and muscular as ever. In an all new avatar, the Endeavour gets some seriously lip-smacking goodies in its feature list. It also gets 2 engine options, along with Ford\u2019s Terrain Management System.Background and EvolutionThe Endeavour was initially launched in December 2003. It received subsequent facelifts in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Updates were mostly cosmetic, save for the 3.0 litre engine that was made available 2008 onwards. However, now; 7 years later - the Endeavour hits Indian shores in a brand new avatar. Read a detailed post on the Endeavour\u2019s evolution \u000ahere\u000a.ExteriorThe Endeavour embodies the philosophy of a quintessential American SUV. What that means is, that all dials are dialled up to 11 when it comes to size. The presence of the Endeavour has definitely improved over its previous iteration.The front is marked by a large hexagonal grille that is drenched in chrome. A large blue oval sits slap bang in the centre. Flanking the grille are two massive headlamps that get projectors and day-time running LEDs. The large bumper houses a hard-plastic skidplate that is finished in matte silver. The skidplate extends upwards and forms the housing for the foglamps. The bonnet gets its own share of muscle with strong character lines running along its length. The muscled hood, flared arches and the massive grille work together in giving the Endeavour a dominating face.The side profile is characterized by the 3XL sized doors and large window area. Two faint character lines run parallel to the window area. The flared wheel arches show their might here, they really bring in a lot of character to the side profile.The Endeavour also gets a side-step (footboard) which aids ingress and egress. Note, that it is almost impossible to get inside the Endeavour without using these.The Ford gets 18 inch wheels shod with 265/60 R18 tyres. While we would have loved to see the Endeavour get the 20\u201d wheels that the international version gets, we understand that the 18 inchers are a more practical choice for Indian roads.A touch we really liked, was the chrome tab that sits on the front fender. It bears the engine and transmission details. Ford say that a snorkel can be fit there.The rear ditches the famous tail-mounted spare wheel that the Endeavour was known far. The spare wheel now moves under the boot, just like the Fortuner. The rear houses large, wrap-around LED tail-lamps. A massive slab of chrome connects the two lamps together.We really like the Endeavour tag embossed on the chrome. The large rear bumper gets a skidplate too, which mimics the one at the front.The core USP of the original Endeavour was it\u2019s sheer size and bulk. The new one isn\u2019t a lot different. It is still massive and imposing in flesh. The new Endeavour is 167 mm shorter, 74 mm wider and 11 mm taller than the outgoing version. Wheelbase is down by 10mm as well. Compared to it\u2019s rivals, the Endeavour has the upper hand when it comes to Length and Height but only slightly.The Endeavour looks like an intimidating, imposing, go-anywhere SUV. The brawny size and well-sculpted lines give it an authoritative stance. We will go out on a limb and say that the Endeavour is the best looking SUV in its segment.InteriorThe massive doors of the Endeavour open equally wide to give you access. One needs to \u2018climb\u2019 inside the Endeavour using the side-step provided. While ingress and egress is convenient, the height may be a problem for the elderly.Once inside, you are greeted by a good-looking and well-finished interior. The quality of parts, fit & finish is definitely a couple of notches higher than the Fortuner or even the Chevrolet Trailblazer for that matter. The slab-sided dashboard is split into three sections. The top portion is draped in Chocolate brown leather, the middle section gets a anthracite/ dark grey colored panel that runs from door to door and beige envelopes the rest. Key take away points here is that everything is well laid-out and falls to hand easily. Ergonomically, the Endeavour scores full marks in our books.The Endeavour is a proper seven seater. To make things plush, all seven seats are upholstered in beige leather. This is one of our gripes with the Endeavour. While beige looks extremely neat, it is an absolute pain to keep clean. The shade is a particularly light shade of beige and gets soiled very very easily. Ford could\u2019ve given an optional all-black interior with the Endeavour.The driver\u2019s seat can be adjusted electrically and have healthy range in terms of fore-aft movement. However, the co-passenger gets a standard manual adjust. The view from the driver\u2019s seat is commanding to see the least. You can view the edge of the bonnet and get a nice view of the road ahead. The seats are well-cushioned and supportive. Even for a large guy, the shoulder and lateral back support will be more than adequate. The headrests however are on the harder side. Other than that, the front row is a good place to be in.The second row is no different. The wide bench gets adjustable headrests for all three passengers and a central armrest for when the middle passenger isn\u2019t around.This row can be slid front and back to fine tune legroom. More importantly, the seats can be reclined slightly to make the occupants more comfortable. While the bench is mostly flat, it provides reasonable support. The transmission hump is fairly large too, but the middle occupant has enough space to keep his legs around it . Sitting three abreast isn\u2019t too much of an issue, thanks to the sheer width of the car.One can access the third row by sliding the second row all the way ahead. It is key to note, that the second row of seats do not fold up, hence entry and exit from the third-row isn\u2019t the most dignified of tasks. With the second row slid fully back, the legroom can be termed as average. However, this row can house adults for only short journeys. Due to the lack of under thigh support, the knees point towards the roof. Not the best position to be sitting in for a long time.All three rows, get their own set of AC vents. The Endeavour is equipped with a dual-zone climate control. The dual-zone climate control lets the car maintain different temperatures in each half of the car. The ac vents are roof mounted for passengers in the second and third row. Second row occupants can control fan-speed and temperature for their row too. The air-conditioner works flawlessly, we have no complaints on that front.The steering is a large chunky unit that is wrapped in leather and gets adjustment for rake. We would have loved reach adjustment as well, but considering that the seat can be adjusted in myriad ways - finding a good driving position is hardly a task.However, it houses a total of 22 buttons! While the array of buttons is slightly disorienting at the outset, it becomes intuitive to use as you spend more time with it.10 out of the 22 buttons are used to control the LCD screen on the instrument cluster.The cluster comprises of a large central speedometer flanked by two smaller screens on either side. While the left screen displays audio information, the one on the right displays vehicle parameters such as RPM, Distance to Empty, Trip Meter etc. Readability is fantastic and we particularly like the horizontal gear indicator on the automatic.The centre console is home to the infotainment system and the controls for the dual zone climate control. The 8 inch touchscreen unit is broken into four quadrants and is color coded. The four quadrants are for Phone (yellow), Music (red), Climate Control (blue) and Information (green). Respective features can be controlled directly from the touchscreen and one need not necessarily use the physical buttons or knobs. For example, the AC can be controlled directly from the touchscreen unit.Response from the touchscreen was average, but it did not lag too much. The unit is connected to 10 speakers splattered around the car. Sound quality is rather nice, most won\u2019t feel the need for an audio upgrade.The buttons below the centre console are for the music system and the climate control system. The switches are XL sized and are good to operate. Quality again, is straight from the top-shelf - nothing to complain about.It also gets two 12V chargers at the front, just above a recess that can be used to store your cellphone. The AUX and USB inputs are placed here as well.The centre console flows into the gear-lever area. 4x4 variants get a rotary dial for the Terrain management system here. Switches for the traction control, Park assist can be found here too.There are a lot of cubby holes around the cabin including large bottle holders in the doorpads, a sunglass holder and recesses around the handbrake lever. Not to mention, the glovebox is XL sized and the armrest gets some storage space as well.Our favorite feature on the interior however, is the active-noise cancellation. It employs the same technology as noise-cancelling headphones. The cabin employs tiny mics above the first and second row that pick-up and negate any unwanted sound within the range of 30Hz to 180Hz. .  It really makes the cabin a super-silent place to be in. The panoramic sunroof comes in a close second, its a shame that it is available only on the top-spec 3.2.Boot space is colossal 450 litres; which can be increased to 750 litres with the third rows folded down. Fold the second row of seats away and you have a massive 2010 litres of boot space. (Note: the third row of seats can be electrically folded in the top-spec 3.2 version; others get a manual handle to fold the seats)Engine and PerformanceThe Endeavour is available with two engine options. A smaller 2.2 litre, 4 cylinder engine and a bigger 3.2 litre in-line 5 motor. While the 2.2 is available with a manual as well as an automatic transmission, the 3.2 can be had with the 6-Speed slushbox only. Similarly, the smaller engine gets a 4x2 variant along with a 4x4 - the larger comes only with the latter.Endeavour 2.2Let us get one thing straight first, the 2.2 litre motor in no way feels underpowered for the Endeavour. Yes, more power is always welcome but the 160PS/385Nm combo does just enough to keep the big Ford on it\u2019s toes. The engine does have a bit of turbo-lag upto 2000rpm post which the 385Nm is delivered in a single gush. Low-end grunt is really nice; the peak torque is achieved at just 1600 rpm. You can get the Endeavour rolling of the line in second gear if you wanted to.If you opt for the 2.2 with the 6-speed autobox, a word of advice - do not be in a hurry. The gearbox takes its own sweet time to figure out the gear it is supposed to be in. Especially when you are heavy on the throttle. Be sure to shift to Sports mode or take control of the gears yourself if you need nothing but performance. However, on a relaxed cruise - the gearbox does just fine.Endeavour 3.2Budget no bar, this is the engine to pick. The 3.2 litre motor compliments the Endeavours bulk and size beautifully. While this motor isn\u2019t exactly a tarmac scorcher either, the 3.2 litre motor has just enough power in its coffers to waft the 2 ton behemoth towards the horizon rather swiftly. Compared to the 2.2, the 3.2 most noticeably has better in-gear acceleration. This ofcourse, boils down to the extra 85Nm of torque that the motor has.Turbo-lag is slightly more evident in the 3.2 compared to the smaller engine, but it isn\u2019t too much of a bother. We really wish that Ford made the 3.2 available with a manual transmission - the 6-Speed AT seems to sap the engine\u2019s prowess.The NVH (noise, vibration & harshness levels) on the both the engines are well under control.  Other than the initial vibrations and shake, the sound is well-damped. It is only under harsh acceleration that these noises seep inside the cabin again.Ride and HandlingThe steering is amongst the lighter units out there. At city speeds, it is just as light as you would want it to be. It does weigh up nicely when the speeds climb. The steering feels nice and accurate at high speeds, there is no vagueness or dead-zone as such. In no way, does the Endeavour feel nervous or twitchy at high speeds. In fact, it is among the few cars that can cruise in excess of 120km/h all day long. However, we would advise you to be prudent when the going gets twisty.The Endeavour handles like a 2 ton barge should. Owing to the bulk, there is considerable amount of body roll when you chuck the big boy into a corner. Do remember that the Endeavour is based on the good ol\u2019 body-on-frame construction and is nowhere as poised through the corners as a monocoque (read: Santa Fe). While traction control will ensure that you don\u2019t spin out, some restraint on the right leg won\u2019t harm.Nothing seems to upset the Endeavour; the 225mm of ground clearance lets it make mincemeat out of potholes and other undulations. All such abnormalities in the road surface are shrugged off with a muted thunk. The ride quality gets a big, big thumbs up from us.SafetyThe Endeavour is loaded with safety tech. Dual airbags, ABS with EBD, Traction Control System (TCS), Electronic Stability Program (ESP), Hill Launch Assist comes standard across trims. The Titanium variants get Side and Curtain airbags, whereas the Titanium+ variant gets an airbag for the Driver\u2019s knee as well!VariantsThe Endeavour is available in two engine options and two trim levels i.e., Trend & Titanium.The first engine option, a 2.2 liter is available in a manual 4x2 or 4x4. These are available only in the Trend trim. The second option is a automatic 4x2 which is available in both trim levels.There is no option for an automatic transmission with 4x4.Coming to the brawny 3.2l engine, it is offered only with an Automatic 4x4 transmission and available in both trims. However, the 3.2\u2019s Titanium trim gets a longer list of equipment than the 2.2 titanium.The Endeavour is one of the best equipped cars of its segments. Apart from the regular bells and whistles, the base Trend variant gets flat folding seats, an 8\u201d touchscreen infotainment system and cruise control.In the Titanium trim, you get a neat set of LED DRLs, front parking sensors along with curtain airbags.To differentiate the 3.2 from the 2.2 in the titanium trim, the 3.2 gets some features like the panoramic sunroof, power folding 3rd row seats and a range rover like terrain management system.While the 3.2 in the top spec (Titanium) seems the most attractive option as it would cater to the demands of buyers in the segment.The Endeavour is one up in terms of pricing as well as on board features when compared to the segment munching Fortuner. The Endeavour is available in two engine options and two trim levels i.e., Trend & Titanium. The first engine option, a 2.2l, is available in a manual 4x2 or 4x4. These are available only in the Trend trim. The second option is a automatic 4x2 which is available in both trim levels. There is no option for an automatic transmission with 4x4 on the 2.2l lineup.Coming to the brawny 3.2l engine, it is offered as an automatic and with 4x4 on both trims. However, you get additional equipment on the 3.2 when compared to the 2.2 in the Titanium trim.Apart from the regular bells and whistles, the base Trend variant gets flat folding seats, an 8â\u20acÂ touchscreen infotainment system and cruise control. In the Titanium trim, you get a neat set of LED day time running lights, front parking sensors along with curtain airbags.To differentiate the 3.2 from the 2.2 in the titanium trim, the 3.2 gets some features like the panoramic sunroof, power folding 3rd row seats, driver side knee airbag and a range rover like terrain management system. The 3.2 in the top spec (Titanium) seems the most attractive option as it would cater to the demands of buyers in the segment. The 2.2 too continues to be a good option as in no way does it seem underpowered.VerdictThe Endeavour, in our books is currently the best big SUV you can place your money on. It seems to have all the right boxes ticked. It has the power, it has the technology and most importantly, the presence and aura an SUV in this price slab should have. If you are in the market for a double XL sized SUV, the Endeavour is a brilliant package. It remains to be seen how it fares against the updated Fortuner, whenever Toyota launch it, that is.

However, its head space is just decent as its overall height is about 1495mm.To start with the petrol version, Active and Dynamic variants are expected to come with a 1.2-litre, 4-cylinder engine that is mated with a 5-speed manual gearbox. It helps the vehicle to achieve a top speed of approximately 145 Kmph, while breaching the 100 Kmph mark in 14.5 seconds. The petrol Emotion trim would be coming with a 1368cc FIRE engine that allows the vehicle to zoom towards a top speed in the range of 150 to 155 Kmph. At the same time, it allows the vehicle to breach a 100 Kmph speed barrier in about 13 to 14 seconds. Its 1248cc diesel mill has 4-cylinders and is mated with a five speed manual gearbox. Its Active and Dynamic variants can break the 100 Kmph speed mark from a standstill in 13.6 seconds and can reach a top speed of approximately 165 Kmph. While the top end Emotion trim is blessed with a slightly powerful engine that can accelerate from 0 to 100 Kmph in just 12 seconds and can achieve a top speed of about 170 Kmph.The diesel versions are going to be powered by a 1.3-litre Multijet engine that has a common rail fuel injection system.

The diesel Emotion trim carries the same engine, but it can belt out a commanding power of 92bhp at 4000rpm along with a mammoth torque of 209Nm at 2000rpm. The Active and Dynamic petrol versions are speculated to be powered by a 1.2-litre FIRE engine that comes equipped with an SOHC valve configuration. It comprises of 4-cylinders and 8-valves that displaces 1172cc. It is integrated with a multi point fuel injection system, which allows it to pump out 67bhp at 6000rpm along with a superior torque of 96Nm at 2500rpm. While the top end petrol trim is equipped with a 1.4-litre FIRE engine that has a displacement capacity of 1368cc. It has 4-cylinders each of which have four valves and is based on a DOHC valve configuration. It can produce a maximum power of 88.7bhp at 6000rpm that helps in generating a commanding torque output of 115Nm at 4500rpm. All these engines have been mated with a five speed manual gear box that delivers torque to the front wheels.This Fiat Punto EVO is going to come with two petrol and one diesel engine options. Its base and mid range petrol variants will be powered by a 1.2-litre engine that is incorporated with a multi-point fuel injection system. It can deliver a mileage in the range of 12.3 to 15.7 Kmpl, which is quite good. The top end petrol version sports a powerful 1.4-litre FIRE engine. It can deliver a minimum mileage of 11.3 Kmpl in city traffic, while producing a maximum of 15 Kmpl on highways. The entry and mid range diesel variants are speculated to be powered by a 1.3-litre Multijet engine that is incorporated with common rail injection system. It can produce a maximum mileage of 20.3 Kmpl (on express ways), while giving away 17.1 Kmpl (under standard driving conditions). While the top end diesel version is expected to come with a slightly powerful 1248cc engine that produces a mileage in the range of 17.5 to 20.5 Kmpl, which is somewhat good.As said above, this refurbished version of Punto EVO is going to come with three engine options for the buyers to choose from. The diesel variants will be fitted with a 1.3-litre Multijet engine that has four cylinders and is based on DOHC valve configuration. This mill can belt out a peak power of 75bhp along with a commanding torque of 197Nm. The high end diesel variant will sport a powerful 1248cc engine that unleashes 92bhp of commanding power and 209Nm of hammering torque. There will be two petrol engine options 1.2-litre and 1.4-litre FIRE. Its 1172cc motor is based on SOHC valve configuration that can pump out 67bhp of maximum power and 96Nm of superior torque. While the 1368cc FIRE engine comes with dual overhead camshaft valve configuration that develops a mammoth power of 88.7bhp and yields 115Nm of torque.As per the details available, its 'Dynamic' variant has an integrated music system with CD and MP3 playback.

The only thing that we are against is the light steering wheel that lacks feedback and feels slack.\u000a The manufacturer has given this sports utility vehicle a proficient braking mechanism and its all wheels are equipped with a set of solid disc brakes. This braking mechanism is further augmented by ABS (anti lock braking system) along with EBD (electronic brake force distribution), which helps in avoiding skidding in case of emergency braking.

Fuel efficiency is not up to the mark.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a3. Initial cost of ownership is too high.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a4. Sunroof and navigation system can be given as standard aspects.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a5. There are still needs of improving its interior design.

Its front tread measures at 1522mm, whereas the rear tread is 1549mm, which is quite good.Editor's take :\u000a The B-Class is spacious and it gets the new instrument panel that will be seen on the next generation Mercedes-Benz. Both the rows have decent space and now it even gets a centre arm rest.\u000a It has a captivating interior design that is now decorated with additional metallic accents along with contrast red stitching on steering wheel cover and seating upholstery. This latest version of model series received a series of updates inside the cabin rending an ultra modern look to the cabin. It is now bestowed with ambient lighting scheme that features 12 different colors, which amplifies the cabin with different themes. The car maker used extensive use of ARTICO leather upholstery for covering the seats and steering wheel in order to give a luxuriant finish to the insides. The most important aspect is that both the front seats have electrical adjustment facility, wherein its driver's seat also has memory function along with 4-way lumbar support. The manufacturer has retained the design of dashboard, but it is now done up with a carbon fiber finish, which gives a distinctive look to the cabin. It is equipped with features like an AC unit, touchscreen infotainment system and a lot of storage spaces.

This luxury tourer has a huge cabin space than anyone can anticipate owing to its long wheelbase along with decent width and height.Editor's take :\u000a Despite being 122bhp, the seven-speed dual clutch box on the B-Class improves the acceleration and the torque spread. The diesel is 108bhp and the torque it produces is just fine.\u000a \u000a \u000a  Its diesel trim can break the 100 Kmph speed mark in 10.7 seconds, whereas its petrol trim takes only about 10.2 seconds to breach it. It is blessed with an advanced 7-speed DCT dual-clutch automatic transmission gearbox irrespective of engine. It sends the torque output to the front wheels. This gearbox allows its petrol version to reach a top speed of 200 Kmph, while allowing its diesel version to go upto a maximum of 210 Kmph.Editor's take :\u000a The 1.6-litre turbo petrol engine is one of the few petrol engines with direct injection. To extract maximum performance, one has to rev the engine a bit harder. The diesel is the 2.2-litre that produces 108bhp and also comes mated to a seven-speed dual clutch transmission.\u000a It is available with both petrol and diesel engine options. Its petrol variant is equipped with the same 1.6-litre mill, which displaces 1595cc.

This mill can pump out 120.7bhp at 5000rpm along with 200Nm between 1250 to 4000rpm. Both these power plants are mated to an advanced 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission gear box that distributes the torque output to its front wheels. However, its diesel motor has received some modifications, which increased its overall power and torque output. It is the same 2.2-litre, in-line diesel engine that has a displacement capacity of 2143cc. Its cylinder configuration too remains to be same with 4-cylinders and 16-valves, which receives fuel through a fourth generation common rail injection technology. This motor is incorporated with a turbocharger for better power output. It is now capable of producing a peak power of 134.10bhp at 3600 to 4400rpm and yields a pounding torque output of 250Nm between 1600 to 3000rpm.Editor's take :\u000a The mileage is decent, and buyers of vehicles like B-Class might not be too much worried about the fuel economy. The diesel returns about 17 km/l on the highway, if you decided to cruise at 80-90 km/hr, it should return even more.\u000a \u000a \u000a Its diesel engine received a minor update, but its fuel efficiency remains to be unchanged. This power plant has the latest generation common rail fuel injection technology that helps to produce a minimum mileage of 13.62 Kmpl on city roads and 18.98 Kmpl on expressways. There is no update given to its petrol engine and it continues to deliver the same mileage as its earlier version. It is incorporated with a high pressure direct fuel injection technology that enables it to deliver a maximum mileage of 14.8 Kmpl.Editor's take :\u000a The power produced by the B-Class might not impress you on paper, but it is very drivable in the real world. The power is just fine, nothing like the C or the E.\u000a \u000a \u000a  Its petrol variant is powered by the same motor that has 4-cylinder and 16-valves with variable valve timing technology. Its is also integrated with a turbocharger that enables it to pump out a maximum power of 120.7bhp in combination with a mammoth torque output of 200Nm. Its diesel motor has the same DOHC valve configuration like its predecessor with 4 in-line cylinders and 16-valves. However, its power output has been increased to a maximum of 134.10bhp, whereas its torque output raised to 300Nm, which is rather impressive.Editor's take :\u000a The accessories list on the B-Class is also high as it gets navigation, reverse parking camera etc. The Edition 1 also gets rear seat entertainment, which isn\u2019t available on the regular B-Class.\u000a \u000a \u000a  It has an advanced CD player that supports various file formats including MP3, WMA, AAC and WAV. This system is also integrated with connectivity features like USB port and AUX-In socket in the center armrest. This system also supports Bluetooth connectivity for hands-free operation and audio streaming with control switches located on the steering wheel. The car maker is now offering this model series with a new generation Telematics Audio 20 in-car entertainment system featuring a CD player, radio and a high resolution media display of size 17.8cms. Apart from this, it is integrated with speed sensing volume control, which gradually increases the volume starting from 20 Kmph.

In addition to these, the list also include stowage crate, shallow boot tub, concertina load sill protector, cool box, tyre pressure gauge and coat hangers.Editor's take :\u000a The handling of the B-Class is decent, however it cannot be compared to any other SUV in that segment. It has some amount of body roll in it.\u000a \u000a \u000a  There is no update given to its braking mechanism or suspension system, as changes are mostly related to the cosmetics. In terms of suspension, its front axle is coupled with a McPherson Strut and the one gets a four-link suspension system, which keeps the vehicle well balanced. This luxury tourer is also blessed with a proficient rack and pinion based steering with an integral STEER CONTROL, which provides excellent assistance in critical driving situation. Its front wheels are fitted with a set of internally vented and perforated brake discs, whereas its rear ones are coupled with conventional disc brakes. It is further assisted by anti lock braking system and electronic brake force distribution along with brake assist system, which augments this mechanism.Editor's take :\u000a The safety features on the B-Class are plenty. It gets seven airbags, which is first in its segment. Other safety features include ESP, ABS.\u000a \u000a \u000a  This model series is now available in one trim level only and is bestowed with a series of sophisticated safety features.

Furthermore, it is equipped with a large fuel tank that has a storage capacity of 55 litres, which is quite impressive.Editor's take :\u000a The drivability of the Innova makes it a real winner than its outright performance. \u000a The petrol ones are perkier in terms of pickup and acceleration owing to its powerful 1998cc. This 4-cylinder mill is paired with a five speed manual transmission gearbox that helps the vehicle to achieve a top speed of approximately 170 Kmph. At the same time, it propels the vehicle to reach a 100 Kmph speed mark in about 12.8 seconds, which is quite good.

It allows the vehicle to zoom towards a 100 kmph mark in just 15 seconds and helps it to touch a top speed mark of 149kmph.Editor's take :\u000a The 2.5-litre engine on the Innova produces only 100bhp and there are more powerful engines available on other MUVs. \u000a As mentioned earlier, this MPV is available with both options for the buyers to chose from. At the same time, the car maker is also providing an option to choose between BSIII and BSIV compliant diesel variants. However, both versions are equipped with the same 2.5-litre, 2KD-FTV motor that has a displacement capacity of 2494cc.

Both power-plants have been mated with a five speed manual transmission gearbox.Editor's take :\u000a The Innova is decent and that is why people generally prefer to use it for long drives.\u000a This MPV is available with both options. All the petrol trims are powered by a 2.0-litre motor that has electronic fuel injection system, which helps it to be fuel efficient. It enables the vehicle to produce a minimum mileage of 7 Kmpl on city roads, while generating a maximum of 11.4 Kmpl on the highways. Its oil-burners are equipped with 2.5-litre mill that has common rail direct injection technology and have the ability to to produce a minimum mileage of 9 kmpl on urban roads, which goes up to a maximum of 12.99 kmpl on expressways.Editor's take :\u000a Nothing comes close to the drivability of the Innova. This makes it a hot seller, even after being introduced in 2005. \u000a As mentioned earlier all its petrol variants have been equipped with a Bharat Stage IV compliant 2.0-litre, 1TR-FE mill that has four in-line cylinders based on a DOHC valve configuration. This produces a commanding power of 130.1bhp that results in generating a peak torque output of 181Nm. While its oil burners have been fitted with a 2.5-litre, 2KD-FTV, which is also based on double overhead camshaft valve configuration. This power plant can produce 100.1bhp of maximum power in combination with 200Nm of peak torque, which is good. However, its BSIV motor delivers this torque output between just 1200 to 3600rpm while the BSIII trim produces it between 1400 to 3400rpm.Editor's take :\u000a The Innova gets touchscreen system, Bluetooth, steering mounted audio, reverse parking camera as standard fitment on the top of the line. \u000a Apart from the GX, its remaining trims including the newly launched Limited Edition have been equipped with a 2-DIN audio system featuring an LCD display. It also has a DVD player, AUX-In socket, USB port and connectivity for Bluetooth devices. Furthermore, it can be operated through a remote, which adds to the convenience. However, individuals who looks to purchase base trim can look for accessories like leather seat covers, stylish body graphics, rear reading lamp, stylish alloy wheels, door visors, mud flaps, and spoilers.Editor's take :\u000a The ride of the Innova is plush and most of the jolts are irons out by the suspension. The handling of the Innova is decent and the body roll is less, despite its large size. \u000a Its front wheels are equipped with a set of ventilated discs while its rear wheels are paired with leading-trailing drum brakes. This braking combination is further assisted by anti lock braking system that provides a skid-free driving experience, especially on slippery roads. The car maker has equipped its front axle with double wishbone system and coupled with rear axle with four link system featuring lateral rod. It is also integrated with an advanced power assisted steering system that offers precise response and supports a minimum turning radius of just 5.4 meters.Editor's take :\u000a The Innova gets active safety features like ABS. The passive safety features include dual airbags for the front passengers. \u000a The car maker has built this vehicle with a GOA body structure, which is its most important safety aspect as it is capable of absorbing accident based impact. It also comes with a list of safety features like anti lock braking system, immobilizer and driver's side SRS airbag. Furthermore, its VX and ZX also has a passenger's side airbag, which enhances its safety aspects.The car maker is offering its VX and ZX with a set of stylish alloy wheels, while the entry level GX have been blessed with steel wheels. These rims are further loaded with a set of high performance tubeless radial tyres of size 205/65 R15, which provides superior grip on roads.1. Luxurious interiors with great cabin space.2. Very useful for a long holiday trip.3. Diesel mill performance is rather impressive.4. Comfort features in the top end are good.5. GOA body structure ensures protection. 1. Price tag is slightly expensive.2. Fuel efficiency is not up to the mark.3. Its interior design can still be worked on.4. NVH levels of the oil-burners can be further reduced.5.

VIntroductionHyundai has always been ahead of the game in understanding and gauging the market and coming out with the right product at the right time. For example, the premium hatch segment was captured really well by Hyundai with the help of the i20.The mini SUV market is taking over the hatchback market. Hyundai failed to gauge the change. They made stop-gap arrangements by putting their hatch, the i20, on stilts. This gave birth to the i20 Active. The pseudo-crossover fooled no one and they needed something more concrete to challenge the Renault Duster. Then began the process of bringing the ix25, already being sold in China, to India. The ix25 is based on the i20 platform and shares its engine options with the Verna. It\u2019s been rebadged as the Creta for India. Is it really \u201cThe perfect SUV\u201d as Hyundai claims it to be? We find out!Pros:1. Well-proportioned and smart looking SUV, based on Hyundai\u2019s Fluidic 2.0 design.\u000a\u000a2. High levels of engine refinement and comfortable ride quality in city driving conditions.\u000a\u000a3. Well tuned suspension. Does not feel \u2018bouncy\u2019 or \u2018twitchy\u2019 like most Hyundais.Cons:1. Could have been priced more aggressively. Fails to justify the price point.\u000a\u000a2. No AWD/4x4 option available, limiting its off-road capabilities.\u000a\u000a3. No Petrol Automatic option on offer.\u000a\u000a4. Diesel automatic & Petrol variant not available in the Top-End trim. Misses out on curtain airbags, 17\u201d rims and faux leather interiors. \u000a\u000a5. Instrument Cluster does not show fuel efficiency and distance to empty. Something that we expected from Hyundai at this price point.\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000aStand Out Features:6. The snappy 7\u201d infotainment system with navigation.\u000a\u000a7. High safety levels. Offered with an option for 6 Airbags, Electronic Stability Program. Fared will in China\u2019s crash tests too. \u000a\u000a8. Diesel Automatic on offer.Overview:\u000aHyundai is managing to create quite a lot of pre-launch buzz around their cars. The Creta too had its share of the limelight. With its \u2018Perfect SUV Claims\u2019, urban SUV design along with Hyundai\u2019s signature dish i.e  a long list of equipment levels, it is sure to make the Renault Duster a little scared. It\u2019s now on offer with three engine options (2 Diesel & 1 Petrol) and a Diesel automatic spread out across 6 trim levels. Hyundai has tried to tick as many users as possible with these combinations and everyone from a city commuter to a highway muncher can find a Creta of their choice.\u000a \u000a\u000a\u000aExterior:The Creta, without a second thought, is the best looking car in its segment. The Renault Duster is ageing fast and the tall stance of the Ford Ecosport is not as well-proportioned as the Creta. The Creta is based on Hyundai Fluidic 2.0 design philosophy. It is a mini Santa Fe of sorts. The car has neat lines and elegant bulges where required. Overall the styling is aggressive, a good character trait to have in an SUV.On the front, you are greeted by the three slats of chrome and a zealous pair of headlamps. The chrome sits in the characteristic Hyundai hexagonal grills. The headlamps are a busy unit which house the daytime running lights at the bottom, a large projector lamp unit, turn indicator and the cornering lamps. The bumper is large and houses vertical fog lamps and a bogus silver skid plate. You will find the fake skid plate at the back too.On the side, the 17-inch diamond cut alloys immediately catch your eye. The fit well in the wheel arches. Only the top spec diesel manual offers the 17-inch rims, all other variants have to make do with 16-incher. The rims are wrapped by 215mm of rubber, same as the Duster. The car has a continuous skirt of black cladding. A neat line runs from the top of the front wheel arch to the tail lamp at the back. Another line runs on top of the black cladding from one wheel arch to another. The car gets a neat pair of roof rails. They are purely cosmetic and cannot be used for loading luggage onto the roof. They give the car a few extra mm in height aiding with the SUV stance.Moving to the back, the design is minimalistic with a trip of chrome housed above the number plate area. It gets split tail lamps and a couple of long, horizontal reflectors on the bulgy bumper. The bumper gets similar faux plastic skid plate treatment as the front.In terms of dimensions, the Creta\u2019s length is 4270 mm which is 45mm lower than the Duster and 30mm lower than the S-Cross. It is a good 270mm larger than the Ecosport which is just below 4 meters to take advantage of the sub-4m tax benefits. Creta\u2019s width of 1780mm is 42 mm behind Dusters 1822 mm.While the Renault Duster looks more like a typical SUV with its macho looks the Creta looks at home in the urban environment. The design of the Creta, just like the Ecosport, feels out of place in the off-road environment. \u000a \u000a\u000aInterior:Interiors have always been a really strong point for Hyundai. The interiors of the Creta is dominant by black. There is beige on the dash that runs from one door pad to another and onto the doors. The fit and finish are top notch, something that is typical of modern Hyundai\u2019s.At the centre of the dash is a 7\u201d touch screen In-Car entertainment system with navigation. The lower variant is offered sans the navigation system, but you get 1GB of onboard storage for your media. You can use Bluetooth, USB or Aux as inputs for the media. It is a snappy unit and easy to navigate around its features. At the top is a small digital clock integrated into the dash. On either side of the touchscreen are vertical air-con vents. These vents are surrounded by chrome inserts.At the bottom are the controls for the climate control system. A nice touch is the mood bar that moves from blue to red depending on the temperature that you have set. The air conditioning unit is powerful and is aided by the presence of the vents at the rear.Ahead of the gear lever is a nice large storage area lined with an anti-slip material coupled with slots for the power socket, AUX & USB. The AUX and USB slots get no cover but have a blue illumination to aid with finding the slot.The steering wheel is a leatherette-wrapped unit with useful thumb contours. The steering wheel tilt (rake) can be adjusted but misses out on reach adjustment. This is a let-down as this feature is available on the i20 but Hyundai has missed out on inculcating it here. However, the wheel is neutrally placed and most people can find a comfortable position. The buttons on the steering wheel are a combination of buttons and switches. The left ones control the infotainment system whereas the controls on the right control the instrument console.The instrument cluster is clean with two identically sized dials for the tachometer (Rev-Counter) and speedometer. Digital temperature and fuel gauges are inculcated into the same dials. At the center is the MID (Multi Information Display). This shows two trip computers which also show distance travelled, average speed and trip time in respect to that trip. The computer misses out to show fuel economy or distance to empty, which we feel is a must have for a car of its segment.The other readouts are traction control & stability control status, key not in vehicle warning, gear shift indicator, outside temperature and the parking sensor display. The stalks on either side of the steering are dependable units in terms of quality. The left houses control for the front & rear wipers. The right stalk controls the turn indicators and controls for the headlamps & fog lamps.On the dash, on the driver's left is the start stop button and on the right are control switches for traction control, instrument cluster illumination and headlamps levelling to set the throw of the headlamps. The key less system is a really smart unit which not only detects the presence of the key in the vicinity but also detects if it is inside or outside the cabin. You can access the car by a request sensor on the driver's side door. Just click the black button and it detects if the key is around to unlock the car. There is no need to pull the key out of your pocket. Once you are in, just hit the clutch with the start-stop button to bring the car to life.The wing mirrors are electrically controlled and foldable from the console on the door. The power window controls are on the door armrest along with the central locking control. The door houses the front speaker and has ample storage space with provision to store a 1L bottles.The glove-box is neither illuminated nor cooled. It is made of hard plastic and does not have a lining either.Moving to the top, the sun visors again are a let down in terms of quality for the price tag the Creta commands. Passenger side visor gets a vanity mirror without illumination and the driver side visor gets a simple strap for a ticket holder. The cabin lights at the front are two individual units separated by the switch and Bluetooth mic. The sunglass holder in integrated into the same unit.The seats are covered in black fake leather with white stitching which have a rich feeling to them. The lower variants get a fabric treatment to the seats. The seats are comfortable and the driver seat can be adjusted for height. Finding a driving position is easy and headroom is ample. However, we found the shoulder room to be on the lower side.Moving to the rear, the seats continue to get the same treatment as the front. There is ample leg room and the seating position is relaxed. This may translate to strain on your lower back during the longer drives but is not much of an issue. There is a centre armrest with cup holders. Even though the floor hump  is really small, we found that the rear seats are more suitable for 2 adults as opposed to 3. You get two large adjustable headrests, rear air-con vents and a charging point.However, because of the design of the car, you get small rear windows which makes visibility for the rear passengers difficult. This also contributes to a claustrophobic feeling at the back.\u000a\u000aWhen you go all the way back, the boot stands at 400 litres. This is smaller than the dusters 475 litres. While this is ample space for the weekend trips, more space can be made by dropping the rear seats which fall down flat. Well, almost flat.  We feel the fit and finish along with the quality of interior are exactly where they need to be with a car in this segment, but we expect more from Hyundai and there are many features that have been missed out that are already available on lower variants. As a Hyundai, the Creta fails to justify its higher price tag.PerformancePetrol:The petrol engine on Creta is the 1.6L VTVT unit carried over from Verna. This engine churns out 121bhp of power and 151Nm of torque. This puts it at the top of Ecosport\u2019s 110bhp and Duster\u2019s 103bhp. The Creta Petrol is on offer with two gearbox options. A 6 speed AT and a 6 speed MT. As we haven't had the chance to get out hands on the automatic, we're reserving our impressions to the manual.The petrol engine feels lethargic. The power is available at the top the rev range and needs to be pushed hard to extract its best. When we drove it on the highway, overtaking usually involved going down a gear to complete the overtake manoeuvre.  At higher RPMs the engine sound does make its way into the cabin. This is not very harsh and pleased our petrol head ears. The engine is mated to a 6-Speed manual gearbox. You have no option for an automatic here.The ARAI rating for the petrol stands at 15.29kmpl, but our car touched the 11kmpl on the test. The petrol is a perfect option as a city runabout. If you\u2019re looking at a heavier usage, you will have to look at the Creta\u2019s diesel line-up.Diesel:The Creta is offered with two Diesel engine options. A 1.4L CRDi and a larger 1.6L CRDi. The first 3 variants offer the 1.4L engine and the top 3 variants offer the 1.6L engine.\u000a\u000a1.4L CRDiThe engine, which is also found in the i20 makes 89bhp of power and 220Nm of torque. This is mated to a 6-Speed unit. The engine has good low-end torque making it well suited for snail pace moving city traffic. While it doesn\u2019t instil confidence on the Highways as the 1.6 does, it won\u2019t disappoint either.As the 1.4 is only on offer for the bottom 3 variants, the option best for the budget conscious who still want the SUV style vehicle in their garage. The engine is suitable for the city condition and the occasional intercity run.1.6L CRDiOne of the best things about the 1.6 CRDi Creta is the refinement levels of the engine. The engine sets into a smooth idle once started. It is derived from the Verna and churns out 126bhp of power which is ahead of the 108 bhp offered by the Duster and 99 bhp offered by the Ecosport.The engine has evident turbo lag up to the 1900rpm mark which is followed by smooth power delivery. The high torque figures translates to fewer downshifts. The gearbox is mated to a light clutch. While the light clutch is a plus, the higher travel of the clutch can get irritating in stop-and-go traffic.The engine comes to light in highway driving conditions. The engine runs 100+ speeds without making a fuss and munches miles with ease. Somehow, the engine feels more at home here than on the Verna.Ride & Handling:One of the stand-out features of the Creta is its ride and handling. The way that the Creta soaks up road bumps and undulations is truly a class apart. Even with the kind of weight, it carries, the body roll is in check. While the car is not meant to be driven hard around corners, the car does behave well when thrown into a corner.The steering, again, is an excellent job by Hyundai. The system is one of the best amongst all they Hyundai\u2019s on offer. At low speeds, the steering is light and effortless. This is a boon for city driving. The steering weights up better than any other Hyundai at highway speeds and shows that Hyundai is trying to head in the right direction as far as steering response in concerned.Safety:In the Creta, ABS is offered as a standard across all variants. The Creta is a great option for someone looking for a safe car. The top end SX(O) variant is offered with 6 airbags, traction control, Electronic stability program and hill-start assist.The Creta is constructed using advanced high-strength steel and ultra high-strength steel. This keeps the weight low as well as enhances passenger protection in case of a collision. This claim was proved when the Creta (Called the ix25 in China) underwent the C-NCAP (China New Car Assessment Program) and scored a full 5 stars. Point to be noted is that the tests were conducted on the mid-range (S+) variant without curtain airbags.Variants:The Creta is offered in 3 engine options (1 Petrol & 2 Diesel) option.\u000a\u000aThe 1.6 petrol engine is offered in 3 variants. Base, S & SX+. The smaller, 1.4 diesel engine is offered in the bottom three variants of Base, S & S+. The 1.6 diesel is offered in the top three trims of SX, SX+ & SX(O). The option for an automatic is only offered with the S+ & SX+ for the diesel while the petrol automatic is only offered with the SX+. The petrol Creta is perfect for the short office shuttles. You can get it in the SX+ trim as the SX(O) is not offered with the petrol. In case your use involves the occasional highway stint, you could go for the Diesel automatic that is offered only in the SX+ trim. In case, if you\u2019re looking for the fully loaded trim, your only engine option will be the 1.6 diesel manual. This certainly is our pick of the lot as the variant is is high on safety features and offers premium additions such as the 17-inch alloys and the leather upholstery.Verdict:If you like to have a bit of off-road fun and the Thar is too uncivilised for you, the Duster AWD will do well on the beaten path. On the other hand, if you\u2019re looking for an SUV and will spend most of your time on paved roads, look no further as the Creta is the best option. The claims by Hyundai about the Creta being \u2018The Perfect SUV\u2019 is a long shot due to the lack of a 4WD option, the Creta is certainly the perfect companion for the urban jungle. This SUV has already won the hearts of many auto aficionados with its breathtaking exterior style and stunning features. It has a bold front facade featuring a triple slat chrome radiator grille. Surrounding this is the swept-back design headlight cluster that is equipped with bi-function projector headlamps along with LED positioning lights.

In addition to this, it also houses vertically positioned fog lamps that gives a distinct look to the frontage. It has a sporty looking side facet, thanks to the massive dual tone fenders and edgy window frames. The door handles in the top end gets chrome garnish, while the remaining get them in body color. Its window sills along with A and B pillars are done up in black, which enhances its modern looks. Coming to the rear profile, it has a typical SUV structure with swept-back design taillight cluster and dual tone bumper. The rear windscreen looks small, but it is accompanied by a large tailgate along with a rear spoiler. The license plate console is placed above the bumper and is decorated with a chrome plated strip.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aExterior Measurements:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIn terms of dimensions, this utility vehicle has a total length of 4270mm and its width is 1780mm. Its overall height comes to 1630mm, while its wheelbase measures 2590mm. Meanwhile, it comes with a minimum ground clearance of 200mm that is good enough to drive through any terrain.The designers at the company have done a pretty good job with its interior design, as they have developed an attractive yet spacious internal cabin. It is done up in black and beige color scheme, which is complimented by extensive metallic accents. The top end version gets premium leather package, which includes covers for seats, steering wheel, console armrest, door armrest and gearshift knob. However, the others have been bestowed with good quality fabric upholstery. The dashboard has a very attractive layered and edgy design, which grabs your attention in the first instance. It also houses an infotainment system featuring a high resolution screen along with a few control switches. The steering wheel has a conventional three spoke design with metallic accents along with illuminated multi-functional switches. The floor console in the cockpit is huge and is equipped with storage compartment and a gearbox console. Not to forget that the seats are ergonomically designed, which is important for traveling comfort. Inside, the driver seat has height adjusting feature and the rear bench seats can be folded in 60:40 split ratio.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInterior Comfort:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe manufacturer has rolled out this stylish SUV in six levels like Base, S, S Plus, SX, SX Plus and SX Option. Its entry level gets some of the features like keyless entry system with foldable key, manually operated air conditioning system, front console armrest with storage, electric tailgate release, motor driven electric power assisted steering and front seat back pockets.

VThis company is a name that has blazed on the trials of automotive history. Here is a company that has carved a unique, undefinable place for itself. It is a unique brand in that, it has pioneered all new innovations to the realm of sports cars, setting the standards a new and making itself a leader in the field, who has stood for the very finest excellence among car making for the span of a century. Among its overly appraised range of cars is the Ferrari FF, a machine of tongue watering grandeur. This is a machine built for massiveness on every scale of its production, from its high-tech infrastructure to its low and amazing profile. Like all this company's line-ups, this one is meant to dazzle its spectators on every level from high to low. Besides just its exquisiteness of character, this car is a machine that builds performance of the finest, combined with class and elegance that few sports cars manage. It guns the engines for the entire industry, raising automotive standards for years to come. The awe inspiring sports car is driven by the toughest engineering, with a performance capacity that nothing short of roasts the streets. A massive V12 engine fires this car, made for a spectacle of speed and performance on the streets. The extraordinary powerplant sends the car sailing to a top speed of 335 kmph, probably one of the fastest vehicles to every touch the roads. It has an acceleration that is nothing short of lethal for our roads, with the 100 kmph point broken in just 3.7 seconds, which is probably the time it takes for two blinks of the eye. Slowing down to the vehicle's expensively crafted outer design, it has a design that reflects elegance and artistic beauty on every level. The machine is low and trim, with a body that is refined for aerodynamic stealth. Its streamlined body is molded for stealth of the highest order. The metallic skin coating is sleek and glossy, riding the exterior with a flawless elegance. Its iconic scissors doors give it a futuristic touch. Carbon fiber technology further improves its exterior build, gifting it with qualities that almost beat that of F1. Built with the sound knowledge of Italian manufacture, it ensures adds the finest element of style and excellence to its exterior build and painting it with the beauty that only this company molds in her build.This manufacturer makes its cars not only to stomp the streets, but to leave an imprint on dazzle and class like no other vehicle can. This series stays true to the grand and classy design that its compatriots from this company have managed. It has the most beautifully shaped exteriors, crafted to reflect artistic brilliance that few people would ever expect a vehicle to have. The metallic skin coating the vehicle is glossy, made so flawless that it seems hard to be of human hands. The build of the machine takes on a profile as low as it gets, meant to grip the streets. It is raised with aerodynamics of the very finest, streamlined and slim to rip through the roads. It is molded for stealthy driving, able to cut through the wind with effortless agility. The roof line slides down very lightly, and merges into the front bumper, so much so that they both seem to be one single stretch without distinction. The front lights are angular and trim, almost fierce in the look they exact on the car overall. The unique, scissor shaped doors are meant to swing outwards, their motion smooth and gentle. The roof line very delicately lowers towards the rear, which is propped higher, giving the backside a bold and menacing feel. All put together, the machine bears the resemblance of a bullet, low, sharp and striking.Exterior Measurements:It stretches to a total length of 4907mm. It has a wide build for hugging the ground, its width going for 1953mm. The sports car is built for the most low profile, with an impressively short height of 1379mm. It has a spacious wheelbase of 2990mm. The front track is 1676mm, and the rear track, 1660mm. The front overhang, along with its rear overhang, are also wide and of a decent, elegant build. The fuel tank capacity is massive, with the space to hold 91 litres.The ground-breaking performance level that the car is suited for, does not, by any means, leave its interior degraded in the quality it is meant to give. The low and sharp build of the machine does not take a heavy toll on the inside, with the cabin space still large and lavishly coated. The Italian manufacturer has always meant to deliver luxury of the most refined sort, and with this model, they take to a new level. The most decoration of the cabin is savored only for the most expensive and unique of material. Premium leather upholstery cover the seats, made and examined for flawlessness on every seam. Rich leather also covers the steering wheel, enabling not only a firmer grip, but a most luxurious aura to bask in, while driving this machine. The interior kit, seat shell, and the dashboard kit are made of carbon fiber. The interior kit also has a neo piano design, meant to uplift its passengers to the heights of elegance. The e-gears are available in multiple colors and designs, with the company's inscription on all of them. Carbon fiber floor mats are available in different color stitches, all of them made for the most homely atmosphere a machine could possibly give.Interior Comfort:A host of features aid the passengers' comfort needs, making sure that nothing is left behind, when providing the best. Fine material layer the inside of the cabin, immersing it in the most luxurious of atmospheres. The seats are covered in flawlessly stitched, premium leather. The steering wheel is also formatted for the very best feel, allowing function to merge with style. It is made of carbon fiber, and covered with premium leather. The plush floor mats that are in it are also made of carbon fiber. Kits of personalized plugs are available for the floor mat. Rechargeable batteries are also provided, along with a 12V socket to charge devices of any kind. A storage compartment is present at the center, with a cover on it. Sun visors are also provided, customized to go along with the color of the car. A heated electric seat kit further adds to the comfort level of this advanced cabin. The seats are made of carbon fiber, as is the interior kit. The kick-plate is also made of carbon fiber. All in all, this is a cabin that lays out the very finest for its passengers, and keeps them cozy throughout.Interior measurements:The sophisticated outer format of the vehicle, along with its cutting edge performance, in no way takes a toll on the measure of space for the passengers. The insides are large and spacious. It leaves ample room for head and shoulders, also enough for taller people.Fired to maximum speed by the awesome V12 engine, the car produces an acceleration and top speed that guns past all city limits, meant to leave its driver breathless. A maximum speed of 335 Kmph makes this one of the fastest machines every built, edging closer to Formula One in its design than any other car has. It can shoot to the 100 Kmph mark within a stunning 2.9 seconds. The machine manages to reach 200 Kmph within 7 seconds or less. It stretches the limits with the ability to reach 300 Kmph in just around 15 seconds. These figures affirm why this company is destiny's chosen supercar manufacturer, and meant to stay so for years to come. This is perhaps a notch more advanced than all other offerings of this company, with most other sports machines built by this company slumping with a top speed of 300 Kmph to 325 Kmph. Furthermore, the acceleration rate of this exquisite range of cars is also raised with this machine, which goes well beyond most other offerings of this manufacturer, which dominate the roads at 4 seconds, while this one nails it at around 3.5 seconds.The twelve cylinder based engine is one of the very best in the world, and it is this choice that this company applies for this vehicle. The 6.3-litre, V12 powerplant has 48 valves, integrated through the DOHC configuration. It is capable of a peak power of 651bhp and a torque of 683Nm. This massive capacity is channeled through a flawless transmission, a 7-speed gearbox with a dry double plate clutch facility. The engine is cooled through an advanced water and oil cooling system in the rear with variable air inlets. A dry sump lubrication system assists with the lubrication, keeping the interior smooth always. Equipped with all this and more, the machine sets out to floor the streets. It shoots to a staggering top speed of 335 Kmph. The acceleration rate is even more stunning, with just around 3.7 seconds needed for the vehicle to zip to the 100 Kmph mark.The most cutting edge technology involves itself in the production of this machine, and no stone is left unturned to bring the best of all features to the driver behind this wheel. The engine is made with both bold performance and efficient fuel consumption in mind. As a result, its fuel economy is at par with all other aspects of its razor's edge build, it delivers a mileage of 6.5 Kmpl, which is not just above average, but enormous. This is for the one reason that sports cars usually deliver a far lower mileage, but this one manages to rake up the standards with everything, and ensures that nothing falls back in the race for grandness on every level.When a conversation about speed on the roads occurs, the first thing that comes everyone's mind is a well modeled, elegant sports car with the Ferrari emblem adorned atop it. The reason for this is founded in the engineering that this car, and all others of this astounding company, boast of. The Ferrari FF is a machine that is set to defy all barriers set for city streets, and to leave its driver's heart fluttering. The V12 engine has a displacement capacity of 6262cc, possibly sliding behind a handful of sports marvels ever made in history. The mighty engine aims to grill the roads like few others would manage. It sends the machine soaring to a top speed of 335 Kmph, dominating all other vehicles setting foot on the road. Furthermore, the machine zips past the 100kmph point in a stunning 3.7 seconds. The engine revs a maximum power of 651bhp at 8000rpm, and a maximum torque of 683Nm, setting it well apart from the conventional cars on the road. All of this power is smoothly channeled through a 7-speed dual semi-automatic clutch transmission.The insides of this high powered machine means to soften things up for its passengers on the inside. The cabin is complete with all the fundamental, standard requirements of any vehicle these days. This cabin, however, goes well past the conventional requirements, seeking to thrill its audiences with far more, and far better. It is equipped with an advanced multimedia system that is sure to raise the cabin experience to the very highest for its passengers. It is fulfilled to its very highest limit, with a music interface kit as well. A digital audio broadcasting system allows for high signal radio airplay. The navigation system is complete with a high definition color display, and top quality, up to date maps to aid in any driver's quest. A Bluetooth connectivity feature further upgrades the accessory functions that this sports car brings to its passengers. This allows for sending and receiving calls from within the cabin itself, and is complete with a special Bluetooth kit.

It is incorporated with a large fuel tank that is capable of carrying around 46 litres of petrol or diesel in it.Editor's take : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe acceleration of the Rio is decent especially with the multijet now powering the compact SUV.\u000a  The firm has coupled all the three engines with a five speed manual transmission gear box. Its petrol mill enables the vehicle to attain a top speed of around 145 Kmph, and to accelerate from 0 to 100 Kmph in nearly 19 seconds. The 1.5-litre diesel motor propels it to cross the 100 Kmph speed mark in approximately 18 seconds. Meanwhile, the variants with 1248cc diesel power plant takes nearly 15 to 16 seconds to break the 100 Kmph speed limit. Both these mills enable it to achieve a maximum speed of around 135 to 145 Kmph.Editor's take : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe 1.3-litre multijet engine is the pick of the lot. Not only is it the most powerful, but is also the most fuel-efficient. Ofcourse, it is the most popular diesel engine in the country.\u000a The stunning series is offered by the company with both petrol and diesel engine options for the customers to select from. It has a 1.2-litre petrol engine that is integrated with a multi point fuel injection system. It comes with a total displacement capacity of 1173cc and generates power of 75.6bhp in combination with 103.9Nm torque. The 1.5-litre turbo diesel mill has the ability to displace 1489cc. It delivers an impressive power and torque output, besides returning a decent fuel economy. This vehicle is also offered with a 1.3-litre diesel power plant that is integrated with a common rail direct injection system. All these motors carry four cylinders that are further fitted with 16 valves. These are skillfully coupled with a five speed manual transmission gear box that enables smooth transmission of gears in high traffic zones. The petrol mill, which is compliant with the BS IV emission standard norms has naturally aspirated air charging system, while the other engines have a fixed geometry turbocharger along with an inter cooler.Editor's take : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe mileage of the Premier Rio is decent, especially the multijet and the TUD5 diesel engine.\u000a  The CRDi4 based diesel motor is capable of giving a mileage of around 21 Kmpl on highways and nearly 17 Kmpl within the city. The 1489cc diesel mill returns about 16 Kmpl on the bigger roads, which comes down to approximately 12 Kmpl in urban areas. On the other hand, the fuel economy offered by the 1.2-litre petrol engine ranges from 8 to 12 Kmpl approximately.Editor's take : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe power produced by the multijet is good and even the power delivery is linear. Power was the only missing weapon in the Rio armoury.\u000a  The 1173cc petrol mill generates a peak power of 75.6bhp at 5800rpm besides yielding torque of 103.9Nm between 3500 and 4250rpm. This vehicle also comes with two diesel engine options of which, the 1.3-litre motor churns out 71bhp at 4000rpm along with torque output of 183Nm in the range of 1800 to 2400rpm. Meanwhile, the 1489cc diesel mill is capable of producing 63.9bhp at 4000rpm, while its maximum torque comes to 152Nm that ranges from 2250 to 3000rpm.Editor's t\u000a \u000aake : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe Rio gets integrated music system, front power windows etc.\u000a  In order to keep its occupants entertained all through the journey, the company has bestowed it with an audio unit. It comes with a CD player and features AM/FM radio tuner as well. There are also four high quality speakers fitted in the front and rear part of the cabin, which gives an excellent output and better listening experience. However, the owners of this vehicle have an option of customizing it with a few more features. These may include an advanced 2-DIN music system that supports Bluetooth connectivity, USB port and auxiliary input options as well. Apart from this, a few other features can also be added in order to improve its style and comfort quotient as well.Editor's t\u000a \u000aake : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe ride of the Rio is well sorted as the occupants do not jitter even at high speeds. However, the handling isn\u2019t that good and the Rio lacks confidence on bends and corners.\u000a  This vehicle is incorporated with a reliable braking system that performs exceptionally well. The front wheels are fitted with a robust set of disc brakes, while sturdy drum brakes are used for the rear ones. This mechanism is further enhanced by anti lock braking system along with electronic brake force distribution. It has a proficient suspension system that comprise of McPherson strut and coil spring on the front axle and the rear one is affixed with a five rod system. Besides these, handling is made quite easier with the power assisted steering system that gives better response. It helps in easy maneuverability even during sharp turns and supports the minimum turning radius of 4.7 meters as well.Editor's take : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe Rio gets safety features like ABS and also seatbelts as passive safety.\u000a  The company has also loaded this model series with a number of security aspects, which ensures maximum protection of its passengers and the vehicle as well. It has advanced features like anti lock braking system along with electronic brake force distribution and brake assist. It avoids the wheel lock up and protects it from skidding on slippery surfaces. There are three point ELR (emergency locking retractor) seat belts offered at front along with pretensioners, while standard seat belts are available in the rear. It has a strong body structure that comes along with side impact beams. It features child safety locks on the rear doors and includes central door locking system. The high mount stop lamp, which is integrated to the rear spoiler, is helpful in preventing collision. The instrument panel keeps the driver alert always by giving out important notifications like door ajar warning and a few others. This compact sports utility vehicle is undoubtedly one of the low priced vehicles available in this segment yet, it comes with some vital security aspects that keeps its occupants safe while on their journey.The neatly carved wheel arches of its DX and GX trims are equipped with a set of steel wheels, while the remaining variants are fitted with a modish set of alloy wheels. All these are further covered with tubeless radial tyres of size 205/70 R15, which offer an enhanced grip on roads, while ensuring high level of safety. Moreover, the firm has also offered it with a spare wheel along with a cover. It is attached to the vehicle's tail gate and comes with all tools that are required for changing a flat tyre.1. Both the engines deliver an impressive performance.\u000a \u000a 2. Its high ground clearance is the major plus point.\u000a \u000a 3. Ample leg and head room offered to its passengers.\u000a \u000a 4. Spacious boot compartment allows storing a number of things.\u000a \u000a 5.

VIntroduction: Since its revival in March 2014, Datsun has launched 4 models (GO, GO+, mi-Do & on-Do) across 4 markets (India, Indonesia, South Africa & Russia) and started production at 3 plants in 3 countries (India, Indonesia & Russia). Quite symmetrical we must say! However in India, we only have two Datsuns as of now in our market. GO was the first one that made its way here and GO+ was launched few months after that.The GO+ is a compact alternative to the larger MPVs as well as a larger alternative to the regular hatchbacks. The company quotes GO+ as an 'estate / station wagon' that offers 5+2 seating. But it wouldn't be out of place to call it a 5-seater with a large boot (vis-a-vis an optional 7-seater MPV).Pros: 1. The only car in its price range to offer a third row. It can accommodate a total of 7 passengers. All other options in the price range are 5 seater hatchbacks.2. The third row can be folded down to be used as a large 347 liter boot. 3. Has a few upmarket features like the Follow me Headlamps, a comprehensive Multi Information Display, Gear Shift Indicator and Speed Sensitive Wipers which are offered right from the base trim. Cons: 1. Bare basic features on offer. Even on the top end variant you don\u2019t get a proper infotainment system.2. Cost cutting has led to compromise not only on the feature list but also the safety. 3. The Datsun brand is new t the Indian market and the image that it has generated around it is negative. Both in terms of safety & quality. 4. Datsun utilizes Nissan\u2019s after sales network which lacks reach. Stand Out Features: 1. Very high claimed fuel economy of over 26 kmpl. The highest of a 7 seater MPV. The figure is high when compared to its hatchback competitors as well. 2. Practicality of a 7 seater in a nifty size under 4 meters.  Exteriors:The Go+ is basically a Go with extra space in the rear \u2013 so when seen head on, it looks exactly like the hatch counterpart. Everything from the hexagonal grille with a black honeycomb mesh, the V in the bonnet to the angular headlamps with metal inserts and the windscreen are identical. We\u2019ve always like the simple yet effective design of the Go, thus a thumbs up for the Go + as well. In profile, the Go+ forces you to believe how small a 7-seater(5+2 to be precise) can get. From outside, the Datsun Go+ can easily pass of as a mini-estate having a bulbous rear attached to the Go hatchback. It doesn\u2019t look like an afterthought add-on job like we\u2019ve seen on some compact-sedans in market currently and looks very well fused.Side profile of the GO+ is an angle from which you can figure out that this is a wagon, at least aspires to be one. Despite being a 7-seater, the GO+ doesn't have a large footprint. Thanks to the difference of only 210 mm between the GO and GO+. Also, the width and wheelbase are the same. So, don\u2019t expect it to do an Ertiga or Mobilio for you.We didn\u2019t like the huge wheel well gaps that are glorified by the tiny 155/70 R13 tyres. If not 15\u2019, at least 14\u2019 tyres should have been there. At the rear, this gap exposes everything from the fuel tank, suspension to the exhaust pipe assembly.As we stated in the starting, this is basically a stretched Go, therefore Datsun has pulled the bumper further back \u2013 so the rear overhang is quite prominent. The tailgate is extremely light; in fact it\u2019s the lightest unit we\u2019ve ever seen. There isn't a separate keyhole or lever for opening the boot \u2013 that has to be unlocked only through the driver's side release.The number plate on the Go+ has been moved to the tailgate (Go\u2019s housed on the rear bumper). The rear is clean and the overall styling does look convincing. Overall, the Go+ is a decent looking offering that looks well-proportioned.\u000a\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000aInteriors:Except the 3rd row, inside of the GO+ is identical to the hatch sibling. The dash and door panels are of 'greige' (mix of grey + beige) colour. Though plastic quality is very basic and just above satisfactory, sturdiness of the panels is a point worth mentioning here.We quite liked the black centre console that looks quite finished and smoother than the rest of the dashboard which carries a grainy texture. Quality of the plastic panels is decent & the GO+ uses the Sunnys-shaped door handles (save for the chrome).The GO+ uses an old school 'stick' type locking knobs, which might remind you of the car in which u learnt driving, but admiring them is a bit difficult. Central locking is available on the top-end variant only.  The roof feels damn flimsy. There's a lot of crunching & crinkling when you push the lining a few inches before hitting the roof. The sun visors have been carried over from the GO and don't get vanity mirrors.\u000aThe Go+'s wheelbase is longer than most of our hatchbacks. As a result, there\u2019s ample space in both the rows. What we also liked is the decent shoulder and headroom. Ingress and egress is convenient. Corners of the dashboard slope inward, which is boon for older drivers who sit first and then swing their legs. Though, an adjustable steering would have made it very comfortable.\u000aGO+\u2019s front seats are 'connected' to each other - like the HM Ambassador. The driver's chair is a conventional one, it's the front passenger's seat that has an extension to fill the gap. Datsun says that area in-between is useful for placing knick knacks & handbags. But we think \u2013it\u2019s not that thoughtful because in case someone tries to sit there(which we\u2019re sure many would), can be risky.The seats feel offers ample comfort and feels more foamy than cushiony. It gets integrated headrests and the seat cushioning remains thin. Knees of the rear occupant can be felt through the seat, which\u2019s annoying on certain occasions.Performance:Petrol: \u000aThe compact MPV is powered by the familiar 3-cylinder, 1.2-liter petrol from the GO & Micra Active hatchbacks. It churns out the same 67 BHP @ 5000 rpm & 104 Nm of torque @ 4000 rpm. The ARAI puts its fuel economy at 20.62 kmpl that\u2019s just 0.01 kmpl lower than the GO.Despite the same motor churning out the same number of horses as in the Go, that too having an added 20 kilograms to pull, the Go+ doesn\u2019t gives you a chance to complain. The motor has been re-tuned, but the altered ECU tune hasn\u2019t changed the eager nature of the three pot mill. Engineers at Nissan have done a great job in enhancing the overall drivability and refinement of the motor.Thanks to its healthy power and torque to weight ratios, Go+\u2019s engine feels quite peppy and the throttle is responsive too. The MPV doesn't feel sluggish, although continuous downshifting helps might irritate you a bit. It\u2019s reasonably quick in a dash to 100 kmph and able to easily attain & sustain 120 kpmh. Though we don\u2019t recommend going over that speed. Period.NVH & Insulation is better than Go hatch, but engine as well as wind noise permeate through the cabin easily. Not just motor's gruff note, you can even hear the exhaust as well, which we found very irritating. The suspension is also noisy, accompanied by excessive tyre noise on bad roads.Ride and Handling:\u000aGo+ offers a really pliant ride. Its suspension has been tuned to deal with the greater load at the rear, but seems quite pliant and absorbent overall. The light controls make it very easy to drive within the city and the small turning radius of 4.6 meters is like icing on the cake.The steering is light enough at low speeds, and weighs up when you hit the highway. Like other electronic units, this doesn\u2019t feel too nervous or unsure at higher speeds.The MPV is not a corner carver and isn\u2019t meant to be one either. Body roll is quite evident during the drive. At higher speeds, the car feels wafty and, on uneven highways, becomes bouncy at the rear.We would recommend upsizing the tyres as the stocks ones are too puny for the GO+. Also, they are produced by an unknown Strada brand. Upgrading them to a 175 size from a reputable manufacturer is what we would suggest.\u000a\u000aSafety: Safety is one of the biggest concerns with the Go +. When its younger sibling, the Datsun Go, was put through the Global NCAP crash test, the results were dismal. It scored zero stars and the testing authority claimed that even if the Go were to be tested with airbags, the results would bear no difference. The car's structure was just so bad. The Go + is similar to the Go in terms of structure and this is where our concerns lie. Datsun had to trade off a features to keep the costs in check and safety seems to have taken the biggest brunt. While the Go + is sold with an optional driver airbag, we highly recommend looking for a safer alternative. \u000a\u000aVariants:\u000a The feature list of the Datsun Go +, even on the top end variant is small. The Go + is offered in a total of 5 trim levels. The base trim (D) gets a few stand out features like the follow me home lamps and 3rd row seats. However, the airconditioning is available only on the next (A) trim. You do miss out on power steering here which is offered on the A (ESP) variant. ESP standing for electronic power steering. The one with an AUX input with 4 speakers media system and phone dock is found on the (T) trim. The AUX is the only option for your media requirements as there is no option for a USB, CD or Bluetooth input. The USB on offer is only for charging your device.  Along with this, the (T) trim offers power windows. The only safety feature on offer is a driver side airbag on the top end T (O). We highly recommend opting for this variant. Verdict:\u000aThough Datsun insists on calling it a seven-seater, the Go+ isn\u2019t exactly a proper one. The third row can only accommodate luggage and can't really be used to seat any adult. But if you look at it as a five-seater, with a decent amount of luggage space, then the Go+ makes more sense.

VBMW India, the completely owned subsidiary of the foremost luxury car brand from Germany has introduced the facelifted version of its premium vehicle \u000aBMW 6 Series\u000a Gran Coupe. In the year 2013, it had received a few cosmetic tweaks to its exteriors. Now again, the company has updated its exteriors making it sleek yet bold in its class. It gets new set of LED headlamps along with a refined radiator grille and a revised front bumper. This latest version now gets full LED lights as standard fitment, which emphasizes its refreshing new appearance. The design of the side and rear facets seems to be the same, but the updated alloy wheels gives it an extraordinary appeal. The manufacturer made no changes to the interior design, but has covered the seats with two-tone leather upholstery. Apart from this, all its other features are retained from the outgoing model. This vehicle has been brought to the country via CBU route, which makes it a little expensive. However, this may not affect its sales, since it is one of the most desired four wheelers built by company. It is now made available in four new exterior paints like Cashmere Silver, Melbourne Red, Mediterranean Blue and Glacier Silver. Currently, this vehicle is introduced in two trims, which are 640d Eminence and a 640d Design Pure Experience. Both are powered by the same 3.0-litre, six cylinder diesel engine, whose transmission duties are handled by the 8-speed steptronic sports automatic transmission gearbox. It reaches a 100 kmph speed mark in just 5.4 seconds, which is rather astounding.

There is also the Grand Coupe, which is a four-door version of the 6 Series. \u000a  Its transmission duties are handled by the 8-speed Steptronic Sport automatic transmission gearbox that sends out torque to all four wheels. This vehicle can reach an electronically regulated top speed of 250 kmph. It can break the 100 Kmph speed mark in approximately 5.6 seconds.Ed's take\u000a : The engine and performance of the 6 Series, Convertible and even the Grand Coupe is as good as any luxury car.

In addition to this, it also has an automatic start/stop button that switches off the engine automatically when this coupe is at standstill.Ed's take\u000a : An M division BMW is all about power and outright performance and handling, fuel efficient is the least concern for a buyer. But the recent downsizing of the engine has helped to increase the fuel efficiency of the M6. The regular 6 Series is also fuel-efficient. \u000a  Both the options are fitted with V6 oil-burner that received no modifications to its specifications. It is integrated with a latest generation common rail direct fuel injection technology. This mill enables the vehicle to produce a minimum of 14.7 Kmpl on city roads that goes up to a maximum of 17.54 kmpl on highways.Ed's tale\u000a : The M6 is powerful on paper and this is a front engine, rear wheel drive car. This is certainly great, even the conventional 6 Series is quick. \u000a  Like mentioned above, this series is powered by the same six cylindered motor that is based on DOHC valve configuration. It is integrated with a twin-power turbo charging unit unleashing a maximum power of 313bhp that yields in a commanding torque output of 630Nm.Ed's take\u000a : The 6 Series and M6 can be customised as per the client\u2019s need and one can add several embellishments from the thousands of options that are available. \u000a  The automaker continue to offer sophisticated BMW ConnectDrive aspects which includes various software applications, BMW live and connectivity support for Bluetooth and USB devices.

They are further loaded with high quality superior quality brake calipers for unmatched braking performance. In addition to this, it has an anti lock braking system and brake assist. In terms of suspension, both the front and rear axles are fitted with Dynamic Damper Control with infinite and independent damping mechanism.

Inclusion of memory function to seats add to its advantage.\u000a \u000a 5. Acceleration and pickup is rather impressive.1. There are no updates given to the mill.\u000a \u000a 2. Boot compartment is not as spacious as other contenders.\u000a \u000a 3. Initial cost of ownership is very expensive.\u000a \u000a 4.

V\u000aWhen the Mini was conceptualised, they were meant to be small on the outside with decent room on the inside. They were supposed to be easy to drive and cheap to maintain. They were frugal as well. It was everything you needed from  an everyday commuter. Today, the Mini stands at the exact opposite end of the spectrum. You\u2019re going to buy a Mini to grab those eyeballs and to put it bluntly, show off. \u000a\u000aIs it still the Mini we\u2019ve always adored? We find out. \u000a\u000aPros: \u000a1.The 2 litre engine with two turbos spews out 192 horses. Makes the car a true pocket-rocket!  \u000a2.The precise feedback from the steering keeps you in control all the time. It\u2019s huge fun on hilly sections and corners too. \u000a3.The suspension is tuned on the stiffer side. This makes its go kart like handling an enthusiast\u2019s delight. \u000a\u000aCons: \u000a1.While the stiff suspension is fun on winding roads, it isn\u2019t comfortable  on city roads that are full of and speed breakers. \u000a2.The rear seat space continues to be small and unusable. Best left to kids or luggage. \u000a3.With an on road sticker price of close to INR 50 lakh, there are bigger and more comfortable options in the market. \u000a\u000aStandouts: \u000a1.The fabric roof folds down in 18 seconds at the flick of a switch. Can be done on the move too, at speeds up to 30km/h.\u000a2. Even with the big sticker price, it still is the cheapest convertible you can buy. \u000a\u000aExterior: \u000a\u000a\u201cThe Mini is a modern canvas with old school design elements.\u201c\u000a\u000aThe Mini term was coined for a very straight forward reason. They were, well, small. It just isn\u2019t the case with any of the Minis anymore. The Mini continues to retain the same design cues, but for one who\u2019s observed the Mini evolve over the years has seen it grow. Not only in terms of size, but a transformation from a functional car to an expensive toy.\u000a\u000aThe front gets the same characteristic round headlamps and a hexagonal grill finished in chrome. In terms of overall design, the lines are more curvy than they have ever been before. The headlamps are updated with LED DRLs. As the version we drove was the S, it gets the badging in red. The other elements on the front include a Mini Badge and an air scoop.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aMove to the side, and the center of attraction is the lack of a roof.  The fabric roof  folds away in 18 seconds flat. Neat black cladding skirts the entire length on the side. The rear view mirror gets some optional checkered detailing to bring out the karter in you. \u000a\u000aAt the back, the dual  chrome tip exhaust immediately catch your attention. The tail lamps have a roundish design to go along with the retro theme  and get thick chrome surrounds. A neat strip of glossy black flanks the number plate and gets the Mini logo. \u000a\u000aThe Mini Cooper\u2019s exteriors is basically a modern canvas with old school design cues. It is hard to execute, but we have to admit, Mini has pulled it off. \u000a\u000aInteriors: \u000a\u000a\u201cA retro design that\u2019s functional. Something that you rarely come across.\u201c\u000a\u000aThe same design philosophy of modern meets  retro continues on the inside. Almost all elements on the interior run a circular theme. While rounded designs may seem boring, the choice of a black and red interior livens the cabin. \u000a\u000aStep into the driver's seat and you find a snug fit. The cushioning, side bolstering & lateral support is the best we\u2019ve seen till date. The only drawback, they are not electrically adjustable. Manual seat adjust in a car that costs INR 50 lakh is just not done!  \u000a\u000aThe steering wheel is a chunky unit with neat red-stitch detailing. The ergonomics was evident from the second I placed my hand on this wheel. The optional paddle shifters and the steering mounted buttons are perfectly accessible. \u000a\u000aThe dials have an eclipse design with the large speedo taking center stage. The rev counter peeps out from the side. All other details are displayed on the Multi Information Display on the bottom half of the speedo. \u000a\u000aThe center console houses one of the biggest circular elements in the cabin, other than the steering wheel. It nestles the rectangular multimedia system along with complementing control buttons below it. \u000a\u000aMove further down and an array of airplane cockpit theme flip switches get individual slots. All of the elements on the center console get chrome bezels that gleefully bounce off sunlight  when the roof is pulled down. \u000a\u000aThe whole dashboard is separated by two red L shape elements with certain elements on the dash get a carbon fiber like pattern. \u000a\u000aOn either ends are circular air vents while the ones adorning the center console are rectangular. Each get an old school knob to control airflow. \u000a\u000aBetween the driver & passenger seat is a touchpad system to control the multimedia system, quite similar to the systems on Mini\u2019s parent company, BMW. The rear is the biggest let down. Even with increased knee-room when compared to the previous edition, the rear is simply not accommodating. This renders the car a 2 seater in our books. \u000a\u000aThe boot too has seen an improvement and now stands at 215 liters. \u000a\u000aThe interior carries a retro charm but is functional. Something that you rarely see go hand in hand. \u000a\u000aPerformance \u000a\u000a\u201cReally powerful go-kart. Plaster\u2019s a smile across your face.\u201d\u000aThe Mini Cooper S Convertible comes with a 2.0 litre, twin turbocharged petrol motor. This is mated to a 6 speed steptronic gearbox. The engine spews out 192 horsepower and 280 Nm of toque. That is a lot of power for a car of this size. \u000a\u000aThere are three driving modes on this car. Green, Mid & Sport. Each of these modes doing justice to their names. \u000a\u000aWhen in the driving seat, everything works in perfect tandem with each other. The instant throttle response, the quick shifts from the gearbox and the precise steering feedback make this car really fun to drive. The car takes on corners really well with its stiff suspension. We had huge fun thanks to this setup, but when we hit cobbled stretches of road, we wanted something more soft and  comfortable. However, it is very rarely that you can have the best of both worlds. \u000a\u000aWe drove on a test section with a slalom and brake stretch. The brakes bring the car to a halt from 120-0 in 40 meters. This car is your perfect companion to open  roads, sunny days and beautiful scenery. Not only because it fits right in but gives you the liberty of having wind in your hair. Something that you cannot really put a price on. . \u000a\u000aVariants: \u000a\u000aThe Mini Cooper Convertible in on offer in  the S trim only.  The car features a set of 16\u201d alloy wheels as standard. It has a 6.5\u201d infotainment screen on the centre console with a climate control. Other Bells and whistles include leather seats, ambient lighting and every other imaginable feature for a car in the price segment. Mini allows you to customize your Mini with optional add ons such as John Cooper works Floor Mats & Door Sills, Black & Grey Checkered detailing on the side scuttle, rear view mirror and outside mirror caps. \u000a\u000aSafety \u000a\u000a\u000a\u201cTicks all the boxes on the safety checklist.\u201c\u000a\u000a\u201cTicks all the boxes on the safety checklist.\u201cThe Mini comes loaded with a host of safety features. You get Automatic Stability & Traction control.  Other onboard safety systems include Anti lock brakes & brake force distribution. \u000a\u000aThe car also comes loaded with touches like the direction adapting headlamps and active roll bar system that spring into action in case of a roll over. A must have feature in convertibles due to the lack of a solid roof. There are 6 airbags on the Mini Convertible. They include the driver + front passenger airbag along with two head & side airbags.

VThe automotive industry in India carries a wave of variations, with companies representing a unique niche for their design ability and engineering. The range of companies that have shaped the car making in Indian soil has evolved greatly over the course of history. And among the many brands, Tata has stood out as one of the greatest. Here is a company that has towered above the rest, re-shaping the field of car making in the country. It was originally founded in 1945, and over the course of two thirds of a century, this company has endured as one a name steeped in glory. The line-up of cars and other vehicles that this car maker designed have assimilated Indian roads, and even seeped into the culture that now runs our roads. The brand is known for providing quality products that are, nevertheless, accessible and within the reach of common man. The range of vehicles that the company peaks with the \u000aTata Sumo\u000a, an SUV designed for a range of on and off road uses. This is a model that has been in production for more than two decades now, originally released in 1994 to a market that was heading for stagnation. The release of the Sumo re-vitalized the Indian car market, and brought new vigor to a production industry that had slowed down and was heading for a dry-run at that period. Over the years, it found its well settled place in numerous fields of use, ranging from taxis to government vehicles to police wagons. Until today, this SUV reclaims its old fashioned build in a greatly modernized industry, and yet survives as one of the most imperative manufactures in our nation.The vehicle is tall and heftily built, evoking the design discipline of other SUV brands such as Hummer. The inside of the machine carries a powerful, 3.0-litre CR4 engine that has a displacement capacity of 2965cc. The powerful build of the engine also generates other stunning figures, including a peak power of 83hp, and a maximum torque of 250Nm. It can reach a top speed of 146 kmph which is, again, decent considering the design elements and the purpose of the SUV. All of this is sealed with the capacity to hold a larger load and to keep up the stability of its drive always on the roads. Therefore, despite the meeker figures of performance, this is a vehicle that holds true to other features of driving. It guarantees a solid experience with other facets of build as well, including a well trimmed interior design that falls short of little that one could ask for.A rich black linen interior is present for the cabin of the SUV, meant to appeal to a more refined classiness. The seats are large and well laid, comfortable and meant for the best accommodation. The seating arrangement is good, and grounded in firm ergonomic principle. A stylized instrument cluster with a chrome ring appeals to a great decoration for the passengers. The interior of the machine is fulfilled on all aspects, including techno ones. The driver is always kept on guard with a Tachometer on the instrument cluster. Further raising the convenience aspect is a low fuel indicator, also bringing better safety to the fore of the passengers' needs. The steering mechanism is based on rack and pinion steering system that provides best comfort and safety for the ride. Power windows aid the fluctuating preferences of the passengers when seated within the cabin, and the glasses of the windows are tinted for a cooler and more enhanced feel within the cabin. It is also complete on all fundamental necessities, such as a windshield wiper, also aided with a rear windshield wiper as well. A rear defogger also upgrades the convenience needs of the passengers. Further essential elements of convenience is taken care of, with a spare wheel below the floor. A 12V outlet on the center console is also a vital convenience necessities fulfilled. An anti glare rear view mirror provides security as well as comfort. Cup holders are present on the glove box lid, and a mobile holder gives added function. The floor console is complete with a handbrake.Moving to a more intimidating prospect, the exterior design of this machine is far beyond fulfilled on its needs. It has lines that are rigid and less sensual, unlike sports cars of the day. It is a vehicle that boldly adheres to the old fashioned grounding in its looks, evolving over the years but never wavering from the core of its make. It makes for its own niche of appeal to true vehicle lovers in that one make. The front bumper is wide and sinking lower towards the ground. The frontage is complete with a grille that is propped on either side by large and rectangular headlamps, and the company's emblem perched right at the centre. Wide air ducts sit below the grille, meant for providing circulation to the large engine. The roofline rises higher than most vehicles, and ducks towards the rear for a more conventional look. The rear of the machine carries lamps of the same format, complete with all fundamental needs that lamps of SUVs had. A large spare tyre sits wrapped at the centre of the rear, giving the machine its more distinguished field of appearance with respect to the sealing of its rear look. All put together, this is a machine that slams as a true achievement, never swaying from the soul of its purpose, and yet staying as a great model that is revered by the Indian market across two decades, and is sure to continue on this road of glory for some time now.

VIntroductionThe Audi Q3 has been on the Indian roads for quite a while now and has also seen a few updates, the most recent once being rolled out in mid-2015. It has been one of Audi\u2019s best-selling models in India and understandably so, considering the craze for affordable compact SUVs even in the higher end of the market. It was initially bought to compete with its German rivals in the luxury segment, but ended up dominating it. Let\u2019s see what makes this premium SUV so successful and what has been added to it in its latest avatar. \u000a\u000a\u000aPros1. The quality of interiors is top notch as is expected from a vehicle in this segment. \u000a2. Reliable and time-tested engine.\u000a3. Paddle shifters have been added to the automatic variants. Need we say more?Cons1. There is still lack of a few creature comforts like a touchscreen, central armrest at the  rear which should have been included.\u000a2. The cabin space in the rear can get quite cramped for three people.\u000a3. In terms of handling it does not do much to outdo its competitors, the GLA and the X1.Stand Out Features1. The newly offered \u2018Technology Pack\u2019 for the top end variant gives a plethora of features like Satellite Navigation, 20GB onboard hard drive, a new sound system and so on.\u000a2. There is a holder for your cellphone below the central armrest. Placing the phone here lets its use the car\u2019s antenna to receive signals, which in turn helps conserve the phone\u2019s battery life. That\u2019s some rocket science right there. \u000a\u000a\u000aOverview:The Audi Q3 mainly aims to attract the young buyers with this entry level model in its SUV lineup. It has been doing well so far, and the facelift only makes things better with some minor tweaks. The engine is still the 2.0L 4-cylinder TDI diesel that has two different states of tune. Soon, another car in the segment, the BMW X1 will be available in a refreshed version while the Mercedes Benz has not made any announcements regarding the GLA\u2019s update (it has entered only recently). The Q3 however, has been packed to the gills with the latest update and should have no problem competing against them. \u000a\u000a\u000aEXTERIORS:The Q3 maintains an aggressive stance while looking the part of a premium vehicle. It looks subtle and mature in terms of its design lines. Some may interpret this as boring, but it gives an overall aura of function over form.  The overall appearance is a bit like a coupe, which gives it a feel of compactness. Comparing it to the X1 and GLA, it  misses out on being the highest just by a few millimetres but length and width-wise it is the lowest. It neither pales nor dominates when compared, but is just good enough to compete.The new Q3 does not mark that much of a radical departure from its earlier designs. But wherever there are changes, they feel refreshing. On the front, the major overhaul is seen in the form of a redesigned grille. It still retains the iconic hexagonal shape, but the grille is now made of brushed aluminium and extends till the headlights giving the vehicle a feel of understated elegance. This is being called the \u20183D Grille\u2019 by Audi and is the new grille design for the whole \u2018Q\u2019 lineup of vehicles. Two creases run along the length of the hood, from roughly the middle of the headlamps to the A-pillars and give it a slightly muscular feel. The front bumper has also been redesigned a bit. There are parking sensors in the place of fog lamps and the shape of the black inserts in the bumper has also changed. The bottom lip of the bumper is slightly more angular with the refreshed skidplate complementing it. All this contributes to the overall look of ruggedness that the car exudes.On inspecting closely, we can see an internal rearrangement of the LED lights though the overall headlamp housing looks the same as the previous iteration from afar. The fog lights missing in the bumper have been integrated here.From the side too, the matured look is evident from the simple character lines that run across the car. The wheels have been redesigned from the previous iteration and frankly, these look a lot better. The window sill gets a chrome finish. The ORVMs can be auto-dimmed on the driver\u2019s side. The wheels are 16 inches for the S Edition variant and 17 inches for the Quattro variants. Accordingly, the tire sizes also vary, with the 215mm (215/65) tyres being used for the 16 inch wheels and 235mm (235/55) tyres being used for the 17 inch ones.Coming to the rear, we see the changes from one generation to the next become even more subtle. The overall shape of the rear fascia and taillights remains the same. The taillights have a wraparound design and a triangular shape giving them a sharp look. The bottom lip of the bumper again has a high stance along with a slightly redesigned diffuser. The exhaust have been given a chrome finish for a touch of elegance.The indicators in the rear taillights have a mechanism where they swipe in the direction in which the car is turning.The roof of the car has a panoramic glass roof that opens in two sections. Go ahead. Stick your head out. There are also a pair of chrome roof rails along the edges. This however, comes as standard only for the top-end variant.Boot space is a class leading 460 litres, far higher than the 420 litres that X1 and 421 litres that the GLA offers.INTERIORS:Interiors are of paramount importance for the overall image of the car, more so in the premium segment of the market. Interiors come in two colour options - all black and black and beige. Personally, we at Cardekho feel the all-black interiors look better. The seats come in black and beige colour options, draped in either leather or leatherette. They provide 4-way lumbar support for that plush seating experience. There is an adjustable armrest between the two front seats below which there is a cradle for a phone along with a USB port. Further below that, there is a storage space and the Audi music interface port at the bottom of it. Both front seats come with the complete electric adjustment but lack memory options. There are some smartly placed Aluminium inserts in the dashboard and the doors, which further enhance their appearance. The rear seat backrests can be folded in a 40:60 ratio or fully, for extra storage space.\u000a\u000aThe steering wheel is the same as the outgoing model. One significant addition to it are the column-mounted paddle shifters that come for the automatic gearboxes. Apart from that, it has buttons. Lots of buttons. The center console has all the different options for media that you might require. There is also buttons for selecting drive mode and engaging Hill Descent Control. The console also has drinks holders. An illuminated glove compartment can be found below the dash on the passenger side, though a chilled option would have been appreciated.The Instrument cluster now comes with a small screen in the center that gives the information from the MMI module. It also gives turn by turn navigation in the top variant, eliminating the need to completely look away from the road while following directions.There is an MMI screen that pops up from the dashboard over the center console. It is a high resolution 7\u201d colour screen with high quality map view. It gives detailed route information on a splits creen. It also works as a parking assist rear camera with guidance lines changing in the direction of car motion, but only on the topmost variant you get this assist as well as the navigation option.The rear can get a bit cramped for three full adults, and the lack of an armrest here also feels dissatisfactory. Additional storage spaces inside the vehicle come in the form of a few pockets which are present on all the doors and mesh pockets present behind the front seats. A 1.5L bottle can conveniently fit in the door pockets.PERFORMANCE:The Q3 comes with the turbocharged 2.0L 4 cylinder diesel TDI engine from the previous generation in two different states of tune. The emissions comply with Euro IV norms.The base 30 TDI S Edition variant gets a tune that gives out 138.13bhp or power at 4200rpm and 320Nm of torque at 1750-2500rpm. This is mated to a 6 speed manual gearbox. It gives a mileage of 14.25kmpl in the city and 17.32kmpl on the highways.The remaining two variants, called 35 TDI Quattro Premium and 35 TDI Quattro Premium Plus, get a differently tuned engine that gives 174.33bhp at 4200rpm and 380Nm of torque at 1750-2500rpm. This is mated to a 7 speed S tronic gearbox. It gives a mileage of 12.0kmpl in the city and 15.73kmpl on the highways. As the names indicate, both these variants have an All-Wheel Drive whereas the S edition is in Front-Wheel Drive configuration.Both these engines beat the power output of the Diesel variant of the GLA, but pale in front of the 190bhp output churned out by the X1. The X1 is also mated to the tried and tested ZF automatic 8 speed gearbox, which is usually considered a more exciting proposition from a driver\u2019s perspective. The Q3\u2019s engine however is considered to be most refined and when the engine-transmission package is considered as a whole the Q3 consistently emerges as the better car among the three.RIDE AND HANDLING:The suspension system consist of a McPherson spring strut type axle at front with lower wishbones and with 4-link rear axle with separate spring/damper arrangement. It has anti-roll bars both at the front and back. The ride is quite good at low and medium speeds and even on the highway. The different drive modes on offer are not that noticeably different for the average driver. The ride overall however, is quite comfortable. Unless the bumps are too large, they are hardly noticeable. The steering does not give the greatest feedback, but does well in terms of overall precision. The vehicle does not give the \u2018sporty\u2019 response that one might get from the X1, but it does feel well planted. The All-Wheel variants have the signature Quattro drivetrain that does help with the acceleration available on tap. There might be some body roll due to it being quite tall. When you factor in the presence of the paddle shifts and AWD, it should make attacking some corners a little exciting although that is not what might have been on top priority for this vehicle\u2019s engineering team.The disc brakes are ventilated at the front and solid at the rear, and both are 16\u2019\u2019 in diameter. It does have Hydraulic Brake Assist, EBD and ABS as standard over all variants, which is quite obvious.SAFETY:In terms of safety, Audi has a track record of consistently achieving 5-star rating in NCAP test of its vehicles. So, it is a given that the passengers of the vehicle are quite safe (unless they are sticking out of the sunroof mentioned earlier.) There are no side airbags at the rear but there are a host of safety systems installed in the car which include ABS, Xenon Headlamps, EBD, Anti-theft alarm, Child safety locks and so on. Even the wheels on the car are fitted with Anti-theft bolts that can be unlocked only by the adapters that Audi provides. So, it takes care of both the passengers AND itself. If that doesn\u2019t spell safety, what does?VARIANTS:The SUV, as mentioned earlier, is offered in 3 variants and all of them run on diesel. The main difference between the variants will be the Drivetrain and the Engine output.The base S Edition variant is a FWD and misses out on Automatic Climate Control, and the automatic gearbox offered on higher variants. Considering the fact that both the X1 and the GLA get an automatic gearbox with and AWD drivetrain in the base variants, the Q3 does not make for a very convincing choice.The Premium and Premium Plus variants get AWD with the Quattro drivetrain and an automatic gearbox. Paddles are mounted on the steering for both variants, and this is one of the most significant additions to the new model. Other knick knacks like the Navigation system, Rear camera and an extra SD card slot are available only on the top variant. The lack of a navigation system in the mid-level variant is the only concrete reason to go for the top-level version. The other add-ons do not justify the price gap very much.VERDICT:The Audi Q3 was already very successful in its segment and gets a much needed boost to keep things that way. The diesel engine has lingered around for a while, but there is not exactly anything wrong with it to warrant a replacement. The design touches make it subtler and mature. If you are someone who is chauffeur-driven and wants one of the best all-rounder entry level SUVs in the luxury segment, this car is for you! You can take it out for a fun spin on the weekends too!\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a

VIntroduction:Audi is a name that's sure to stand the test of time. Here is a company that has got the entire auto realm crackling, with models that have won acclaim far and wide. Despite the strong base that the Four-Ringed company has worldwide, it is still hoping to push up its position here in the Indian market. The A8 is just the type of vehicle you can bank on to pull a feat like this. Just recently, an armour adorned variant was released, targeted at high profile personnel who were looking for security aside from mere luxury, performance and class.Pros:1. Alluring exteriors with some pretty rich make-up. 2. Slew of strong safety features that will surely get you satisfied. Cons:1. Its price range put off a massive share of Indian buyers. 2. The lack of cabin space might be seen as a deterrent for customers.Stand-out Features:1. The advanced range of entertainment and comfort features are sure to have your approval. 2. Its expensively lavished cabin arrangement would be a one-of-a-kind experience for most Indian buyers. Overall\u000a:The A8 has been one of Audi's major standing vehicles for a long time. The car has it all \u2013 the powerful exterior glamour, the intense performance, the affluent interiors and the reliable safety elements. The machine comes with four engine trims, of which two are diesel and two are petrol. All of them make for sound speed capacities, with displacements that range between 3000cc to a thrashing 6000cc. The in-cabin technology would boost any average person's ride experience, with a 7-inch display Navigation system, a parking system, a strong audio facility, exhaustively adjustable seats and many more facilities that most people would never have seen in an ordinary, domestic branded car. Exteriors:Audi is the brains behind some of the world's finest designing, and we'll be honest folks, we found real ingenuity in this car's design. It inherits the class Audi body language sculpture, with the long wheelbase, the prominent shoulder lines and the agile posture. A look at the vehicle tells you that its meant for some old school sprinting, with the aesthetic design and the streamlined shape. A low profile and the back-slapped wind-shield promotes the right airflow when driving, and this also facilitates better handling. We thought that the shaping of the front added a more aggressive vision to the look. The headlamps have a slick shape, stretching over towards the side for a more prominent mark at the front. The Matrix LED light systems add some intricacy to the interior designing of the headlamps, and we thought this made for a more sophisticated look overall. You've seen the classic R8 grille that drapes all the way to the bottom of the front skirt, and the same feature is present for this vehicle as well. The four rings of the Audi mark rest at the top of the grille, gleaming in full glory. At the bottom of the skirt, a thin strip exists for the air dam, and we thought it integrated perfectly into the image of the front. The metallic skin wraps over the wheel archs in an artistic manner, spewing some real fervour over the side. We know for one that most people would find the serene lines that glaze the door-sides gorgeous, and this creative spark is also mirrored in the soothing curvatures that shape the fenders, the door creases and the window line. The well designed wheels come in a range of variants for the occupants to choose from, including 5-spoke, 7-spoke, cast aluminium, forged aluminium and more, so if you're the more picky type, this is sure to enthral you. The roofline slides down gently, before melting into the rear portion in an athletic fashion. We thought that the more toned tail section perfected the vehicle's stance, rendering it balanced and harmonious. When you take a look at the tail-section, there's no doubt the racy impression carries all the way to the rear as well; The tail-lamps spread over the corner of the truck into the tail-gate section, profiled into a neat shape that adds to the visual delight. The twin exhaust pipes come with a slim, rectangular design, another element of proof that this model is as genuine as it gets. Interiors:The cabin exudes warmth, spaciousness and comfort. The only thing it lacks is the crisp sporty spark that race-styled cockpits have. Nevertheless, we're sure that it would put a smile to most ordinary passengers' faces. Some might hold fears that the inner design would be over-done, and so did we; But as we stepped into the cockpit, we felt a mixture of relief and exaltation. Aside from being convenient, the cabin strikes an artistic harmony that few vehicles we thought ever had. At the front, the long dashboard spills over towards the glovebox area at the bottom. A strip of walnut, dark brown wood on the dash adds to the power of the design. There are multiple AC vents which have been equally distanced from each other on the board. A thin piano black garnish at the bottom of the dashboard adds to the marvellous design touch, and we thought that it helped to diversify the entire look. By the centre of the board, the 7-inch colour display acts as an interface for many facilities of the car, including the multimedia system, the reversing camera, the parking system and many others. Aside from adding entertainment to the experience, it imbues the cabin with a more advanced aura, and what more do youngsters today want?By the corner of the board, the multi-function 3-spoke steering wheel is dressed in leather. The wooden segments on the wheel could go unnoticed, but they add a tiny bit of opulence to the place. There are gear-shift paddles integrated into the side of the wheel, and if you're a driver who enjoys an easier way of life, then this is sure to fascinate you. The instrument cluster has been positioned within eye's view of the driver, and it hosts a tachometer and speedometer.The door-sides have been graced with the same fine leather package that engages the entire cabin. Meanwhile, door sill trims come with an aluminium inlay, and this does enhance the vibrant atmosphere. Few people could find things to complain about with the seating arrangement. We certainly didn't; Even the taller and broader members of our team had an enjoyable treatment with the large leg-room and the comfortable seating facility. The ergonomically strong seats are further improved with headrests, electric backrest adjustment, lumbar support, thigh support adjustment and many more aids that are sure to keep you lifted in seventh heaven. The refined leather upholstery enriches the ride quality, and we personally thought that it was the best factor in the entire ride. Performance:Diesel:On the diesel side, there are two engine trims. The first is a TDI V6 mill that comes displaces 2976cc. It comes along with a turbocharger for improved performance capacity, while a common rail injection system ensures smooth transfer of fuel. The six cylinders of the engine come with four valves each, and an 8-speed trip-tronic transmission has been joined with the engine. You're sure to feel delight at the specifications \u2013 a power of 247bhp at 4000rpm to 4250rpm, and a torque of 580Nm at 1750rpm to 2500rpm. For the thrill seekers looking for a more robust performance capacity, a more powerful diesel engine is also present. The TDI V8 power-train consists of eight cylinders with four valves per cylinder, and it displaces a more husky 4143cc. Like its compatriot, it comes along with a a turbocharger, a common rail direct injection and an 8-speed triptronic transmission for the most efficient overall usage. This train generates a power of 380bhp at 3750rpm, along with a pounding torque of 850Nm at 2000rpm to 2750rpm. Petrol:At the petrol front, there is a V8 TFSI bi-turbo engine that comes incorporated with direct fuel injection, an Audi valvelift system, and an 8-speed triptronic transmission. It boasts some pretty brazen specifications, with a displacement of 3993cc, a power of 430bhp at 5100rpm to 6000rpm, along with a torque of 600Nm at 1500rpm to 5000rpm. Sailing past all over drive-trains, the last available engine is a W12 petrol engine that displaces a massive 6299cc. It also has the same intricacies of design as the other mills, with a direct fuel injection and a 8-speed triptronic transmission that make life easier for the driver. The mill's specifications put it well ahead of the rest, with a power of 493bhp at 6200rpm, and a thundering torque of 625Nm at 4750rpm. Ride and Handling:Strong discs have been fastened onto the wheels, and we thought that the halting, cornering and braking process was incredibly smooth. There is minimal body roll, but the high-speed inertia does get into the cabin some time, throwing the passengers off balance. This is the type of company that you expect the best from, and we thought that it did deliver with respect to the suspension arrangement. The advanced air-based suspension helps to ease the flow of the ride, thereby decimating flicker inconveniences. The ride stability is splendid, and you're relieved of most road hassles that you'd feel in most other vehicles. The vehicle absorbs jerks and bumps with a fluidic ease, but knowing Indian roads, you need to be aware that the car's suspension is ill-adapted for more battered conditions. Safety:The company has insulated the high speed menace of the engine with an advanced range of safety features, including Audi exclusive seatbelts, an anti theft alarm, a parking system plus, a park assist that comes along with a display. Also present is a reversing camera, LED lights at the front as well as the rear, a remote control key, a power assisted closing facility for the doors. If you've been in cars that boast high end techno controls, wait until you step into this one: dynamic steering, a controlled sport differential, an electromechanical power steering and electronic stability control together help build a strong ride quality, minimising chances of mishap. Variants:There are four variants, and the major difference among them is the engine trim. First, the A8 L 60 TFSI Quattro harnesses a V8 petrol engine, while the L 50 TDI Quattro comes with a V 6diesel engine. Next, the L 60 TDI Quattro comes with a V8 diesel engine, while the L W12 6.3 FSI Quattro has a W12 petrol mill. Aside from this, all of the trims come with the same comfort, entertainment and cosmetic features, and we think that this bodes well for people who have trouble selecting the right variant.  Verdict:Let's be honest here, we've got a car that we just can't point too many flaws with. It gives you mind-blowing performance, incomparable handling, a sensual exterior cover, and lavishly coated interiors. Driving it is a thrill and a delight, and we're sure few people would have nuances with the experience. But we've got to keep you informed of its extremely tall price tag, along with a lack of an expansive after sales service network. In the end of the day, this is the ideal for for people looking for a masculine, glaring machine with performance and luxury. But for those looking for just a nominal, down to earth drive experience, and those looking to avoid a pinch in the wallet, we'd recommend some other model for you.

VOverall:Honda has found a perfect haven here in India. The company's models are tailored to meet the needs of the general masses, and most of them fared well in the market. The Brio was launched five years back, and since then, it's risen to a good position in the market, so that today most people glimpse the vehicle on their street. Designed with a unique and compact presence, the car invokes a persona never seen in a vehicle before. As we delve through the many sides of the machine, we'd have ample room to find out where it stands out and where it could do better. Pros:1. Handling is very good.2. Many strong comfort features within.Cons:1. Some might find the cabin small and cramped.2. Most of the good features are not present in the low end trims.Stand-Out Features:1. The Integrated Honda Audio system comes along with radio facility, MP3, USB, Aux-In and many more functions.Overview:The vehicle is designed with the purpose of satisfying the varying needs of an average Indian consumer. Powering the machine is a 1.2-litre petrol engine that displaces 1198cc. The engine combines decent performance with a good fuel economy, slotting a mileage of 19.4kmpl. The engine prowess is balanced by a robust chassis, along with many sound safety elements. Coming to the outside, we thought the car's design was fascinating, but some might find the fresh new theme odd. Some plush features animate the look, such as chrome touches, black window frames, and the fine curves. The interior has been given a serene atmosphere. The interaction of the colors and materials in the place makes a more dynamic air. The higher end variants come with a slew of good features, from a radio system to power windows, adjustable seating, an air conditioner with a heater and many more. Exteriors:The car makes its mark with a small and compact body profile, which has also been honed for a racy edge. We thought that the well sculpted wheel arches, neat body lines and agile posture together gave the machine a bold demeanor. At the front, the grille has been furnished with a chrome strip with the company's emblem at the center. The teardrop shaped headlamps have been incorporated with halogen lights and all necessary lighting units. Meanwhile, the broad front skirts wrap over a thin air dam at the bottom, with fog lamps by the corner. The car's streamlined position leaves its bonnet sinking towards the front, and this creates a more attractive impression at the front. The clean design of the hood, devoid of lines and creases, set the car apart in our opinion. The distinct wheel arches, together with the stylish wheels, throw some vigor on the side profile. The subtle creases that run through the door-sides also add to the image, and we thought that the overall effect was brilliant. The door handles and outside mirrors wear the color of the body, and this stirs some fervor in the look. The black highlights on the door frames went along with the image perfectly in our opinion. When you take a look at the rear side of the vehicle, you feel a more distinguished pulse in the look. The tail region looks unlike any other we've seen before. The large rear window at the center and the small tail-lamps by the corner are perfectly aligned. The lower portion of the rear is broader and heavier, and we thought this did spell an odd feel for the image at the rear. Interiors:The cabin is not large, and we've got nothing to hide here. Considering the size of the vehicle, it would be too much to ask for large and spacious interiors. Nevertheless, the presence of some attractive design elements does make up for this, so what the car takes in terms of space, it gives back in the form of a strong drive environment. For the higher end variants, there is a dual tone color theme, and we thought this was great. For the lower end variants, the single tone scheme does lack some splendor. For the top end variant, the dash has been cloaked with an attractive blend of black and beige. The black region covers the top half, spreading down over the center and the floor console in a manner that we thought was attractive. The lower region of the dash, draping over the glove-box region, is colored in Beige for a more balanced effect. Circular AC vents have been evenly posted over the upper region of the dash. Housed at the top of the console is the music system, and the controls to the seating and AC are clustered below. A decent storage area opens out over the floor console, which includes two cup holders before the shifter. We thought that the steering wheel had a striking character, while the Honda label and silver accents further accentuate this effect. A brief overhead hanging stretches over the instrument cluster, which hosts a tachometer, speedometer and other vital readings. The door-sides have been colored in Beige, with a black strip that runs over the door-handle. Nominal storage pockets have been included in the door-sides, but we thought they were too shallow to hold anything substantial. The seats have been given adequate support, while the broad headrests further help relieve strain during the drive. We weren't as happy with the upholstery however, and those accustomed to more lavish ride set-ups would also feel let down. Performance:Packed within the vehicle is a 1.2-litre SOHC based i-VTEC petrol engine that comprises 4 cylinders and 16 valves. It displaces 1198cc, and generates a power of 86.8bhp at 6000rpm, along with 109Nm of torque at 4500rpm. A 5-speed manual transmission is armed along with the engine, and we thought that shifting was smooth and easy. A smooth power delivery works along with the engine, but we thought that the throttle response could have been better. Nevertheless, the engine paves the way for a thrilling ride with a solid sprinting capacity. The second gear allows the car to settle in neck deep traffic comfortably, without the need to downshift, and this makes it ideal for big city commuters. The engine noise and vibration were contained, but very high speeds do ruffle the engine a bit. Ride and Handling:For the braking section, discs at the front and drums at the rear solidify control. Meanwhile, the chassis is composed of a McPherson strut and a torsion beam. Coil springs have been rigged onto both axles, helping to improve stability when driving. We thought that the ride comfort was upto the mark, and the car tackles normal road anomalies with ease. The flow can be hampered at higher speeds and rougher grounds, but it's not nearly as distressing as in some other domestic models. The steering was on the lighter side, and the response was great. We had no issues with braking either, and the light weight and compact set-up of the car enables an ease in taking corners and turning.Safety:We were quite happy with the safety features, which exceed what most domestic brands offer. The downside, however, is that some of the more vital features are absent for the lower end trims. First, the car has been sculpted with a strong ACE body structure, and this helps to minimize damage in case of a mishap. The higher end variants come along with Anti-lock braking system and Electronic brakeforce distribution, and this further strengthens control during the drive. Dual SRS airbags shield the front passengers, but they are not present in the low end variants. Apart from these, standard features include a rear windshield defogger, a driver's seat belt reminder, a day/night interior rear view mirror, and a high mounted stop lamp. An immobilizer guards the vehicle as well, preventing unwanted entry and theft. Variants:There are 5 trim levels, E, EX, S, V, VX. Starting off, the entry level E trim comes with body colored bumpers, a foldable rear seat structure, a driver's seatbelt reminder, front power windows and a fuel consumption display. Next, the mid range trims between EX and V come with some added cosmetics and functions. This includes a chrome grille, body colored OVRMs and door handles, a 1 DIN audio system with USB and Aux-In and a tachometer, rear power windows, a rear parcel shelf and an accessory socket. The top end trim, VX has everything the model series has to offer. This includes alloy wheels, front seatbelts with pretension, power foldable outside mirrors, and many more. Verdict:The Brio is a fancy vehicle, and it appeals to a niche of people. Some of its strengths include a distinct look, stylish interiors and some good comfort and entertainment features. It handles well, and the engine is just perfect for a city drive. On the downside, the lack of space, the below-par speed capacity and the lack of features in the lower trims might put off people. This vehicle would suit those looking for a normal city car with a stylish and modern aura. On the other hand, if you're someone who needs a strong and face model with a more masculine demeanor, then it's best to skip this car and go for something else.

VIndia's largest SUV manufacturer, Mahindra and Mahindra has done wonders in the utility vehicle segment by offering rugged vehicles fitted with power packed engines under the hood. The company has also ventured in to the electric vehicle segment with its \u000aReva e2o\u000a last year. It is currently available for sale in two variants, which are T01 and T2. Initially, when these models were launched, they have received decent response from the buyers. Now to add to the customer excitement, the manufacturer has reduced the price tag of this sophisticated electric car by significant amount of approximately Rs 1.0 lakh. The reason for this is because of the Indian government's incentives for the plug-in based electric vehicles.

This has also helped the manufacturer to offer attractive packages to its customers. For example, if we talk about the price of its base T2 trim in New Delhi, post subsidy, it costs around 5.92 lakh (ex-showroom). However, customers need to pay a fee of Rs. 2999/- per month for the maintenance of battery as part of this vehicle's car protection plan. In case if the customer is not interested in paying the monthly fee, they can opt out of this protection plan, which requires them to pay the full price for the battery. This means that the price of the T2 trim will cost around 7.51 lakh (ex-showroom, New Delhi). This wont affect the company's commitment towards the maintenance or warranty of the battery of this electric car.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis sophisticated vehicle is powered by a three phase induction motor that has the ability to belt out 25.4bhp of maximum power at 3750rpm and delivers a peak torque output of 53.9Nm between 0 to 3400rpm.

V              \u000a\u000a\u000aIntroduction:Mercedes Benz S Class has long been the flagship model for the German marque. It comes in numerous avatars for the buyers including a performance oriented S63 AMG and a Coupe. Last year in India, it received two new variant in its lineup in the form of Maybach S500 and S600. Now, the manufacturer has brought the Mercedes Maybach S600 Guard to India in wake of the launch of A8 L Security. The Maybach S600 Guard complies with the VR10 security standards, which means, it can withstand blasts, grenade explosions and gun firing. It is one of the 12 new products that the German manufacturer has promised for India this year.Pros:1. Executive class seating arrangement.2. Its safety and security features are best-in-class.Cons:\u000a\u000a1. S600 Guard is pricier than its rivals.2. Waiting period for Maybach is way too long.Stand-Out features:1. The new Mercedes Maybach S600 Guard comes with the VR10 protection standards. This ensures impenetrable safety for the occupants inside.2. Its 6.0-litre 12 cylinder petrol engine delivers monstrous performance unlike any other.Overview:Mercedes Benz is the undisputed leader in the world of luxury. Its flagship saloon S Class is perhaps the most luxurious car ever built by the company. The recent addition of Maybach class products to the line-up has positioned the model series in the league of Rolls Royce and Bentley. Now, with the introduction of Maybach S600 Guard, Mercedes Benz has formed a league of its own in the world of automobile. It is an armored vehicle that can withstand grenade explosions, bullet firing and any form of attack. With its incomparable luxury standards, impenetrable protection levels, the S Class is going to compete with the likes of A8 L Security in the country.Exteriors:The new Mercedes Benz Maybach S600 Guard looks exactly the same like the existing S Class variants, but with some minor differences. Only a keen eye will be able to notice the exact difference. As we can see, its external appearance is gracefully designed with splendid build quality down to the closest detail. It is pretty long, wide and reasonably low in height that expresses the royalty from all frames. Further adding to its appeal is the expressive lines that stretches from the front to the rear end through the door panels.While its coupe and sedan versions look completely different from each other. The coupe trims are designed with two doors, and have sleek, bold and stylish body structure as compared to other trims.However, its AMG version looks sportier than the regular variants, thanks to its exclusive package featuring bumpers, alloy wheels, a distinctly designed radiator grille and extensive black accents as well.To start with the front, it has a beautifully sculptured signature grille with thick chrome surround. It is accompanied by the company's emblem positioned on top of the hood.On either sides of the grille, there are large headlight clusters featuring adaptive bi-xenon headlamps along with LED daytime running lights.\u000aBy the sides, its fenders are mated with stylish set of alloy wheels that adds grace to the facet.\u000a              \u000a\u000aThe outside mirrors have a neat, clean design and comes integrated with LED turn blinkers.Coming to the rear section, it has a large tailgate with U shape that is decorated with chrome accents. Surrounding this is the distinctly crafted taillight cluster that is integrated with innovative LED light pattern.\u000aThe overall look is simply magnificent that can grab attention of any automobile enthusiast.              \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInteriors:The interiors exude a quality of abundance that few other vehicles could. As you make your way into the cabin, you're to be greeted by fine leather dressing, rich inlays, chrome and many more elements that make the atmosphere as dynamic as possible.At the front, a large wooden strip embraces the bottom of the dashboard, stretching from one end to the other. The circular air vents have a touch of chrome that makes a strong design statement.At the focus of the dash, the large display hosts the multimedia and navigation systems.At the base of the centre console, a large black inlay is sure to have your attention, while the steel gear knob goes along with the premium air.The steering wheel also comes with inlays of wood, while the large Mercedes-Benz star sets up a more distinguished feel within the place.In front, the instrument cluster has a sophisticated layout, positioned within line of sight for the driver.The seating is the pivotal factor that sets this ride well apart from any other. The well structured seats come with sound support and bolsters, and the rich leather dressing adds a more premium feel to the place.Performance:Petrol:Armed within the vehicle is a 4.7-litre V8 petrol engine with a displacement of 4663cc. The power-train consists of 6 cylinders, and is equipped with a turbocharger. We thought that the specs were better than any other model in the class, with 453bhp of power between 5250 to 5500rpm and a grinding torque of 700Nm at 1800-3500rpm. A second engine, available for the sedan trims, is the 5.5-litre bi-turbo V8 engine that generates 585bhp of maximum power at 5500rpm and 900Nm of torque at 2250 to 3750rpm. Lastly, for the 'S Guard' trim and Maybach S600 trims, there is 6.0-litre engine that comes with 530bhp of power at 4900rpm and 830Nm of torque at 1900rpm. All of the engines are blended with a 7-speed automatic transmission gearbox that makes shifting a flawless affair. Overall, the driver is sure to have a pleasant affair, with a linear power delivery, well channelled torque and well controlled vibrations within the cabin.Diesel:The sole diesel engine here is a 3.0-litre, engine with a displacement capacity of 2978cc. It brings out 258bhp of power at 3600rpm and a powerful torque of 620Nm at 1600 to 2400rpm. It is also geared with the same 7-speed automatic transmission, and preserves a good comfort quality throughout.Ride and Handling:The car has no shortage of techno spills that improve the overall ride quality. An adaptive braking system ensures that the cornering and braking is shaped to its finest. This is further enhanced with many other aids such as brake assist, anti lock braking system, and electric stability program. An electromechanical power assisted steering system helps to keep the response as sharp as possible. We were happy with the rigid chassis arrangement, which easily handled all strains thrown by the road. However, rougher sections can send shudders through the cabin.Safety:A broad airbag system shields the occupants, including dual front airbags, window bags, side airbags and window bags. Along with this, the company has incorporated a slew of other safety programs, such as an electric parking brake, night view assist plus, ESP curve dynamic assist, brake wear warning display, active parking assist, adaptive braking lights and many more. Three point seat belts with belt tensioners keep the occupants secure, while an acceleration skid control, active blind spot assist, crosswind assist head restraints further augment the drive security.Variants:The base variant, S350 CDi, comes along with an electric backrest adjustment facility, a 2-spoke multifunction steering wheel in nappa, THERMOTRONIC 4-zone automatic climate control, a reversing camera, a panoramic sunroof, Burmester High-End 3D Surround Sound, and a navigation feature. Meanwhile, the top end Maybach S600 features a Magic body control system, Designo Black Piano Lacquer trim for the cabin, a front seat massager, a Magic Vision Control facility, a head-up display, Splitview and more.Verdict:This car is nothing short of irresistible. It packs the finest drive experience possible, with a mix of lavishness, comfort, and entertainment, while at the same time, not letting go of performance and inner dynamics. However, its tall price tag would be more than enough to put many people off. In the end, go for this car if you're willing to spend big bucks for a no-compromise drive experience. On the other hand, to those on the thriftier side who just need an average vehicle for A to B commuting, we'd recommend some other model for you.

VFord EcoSport, the product that changed the face of India's compact SUV segment has went on to receive minor cosmetic updates. Ever since it was first introduced in the year 2013, it has continued to dominate its segment and is still doing so. The newly introduced version is being touted as the 2016 version, which gets modified headlamps, redesigned skid-plates and new set of alloy wheels. The update doesn't end with cosmetics, as it has also spread to the variants portfolio and its features. Though the manufacturer has retained all the existing variants, but has added a new trim to the lineup in the form of Trend+. Along with this, it has renamed the top end Titanium Option as Titanium+. Moving on to the features, all the trims get a new set of features, making them even more desirable. Its entry level trim now gets accessory power sockets and 100 percent foldable rear seat as standard. While the versions from 'Trend' will now get ABS with EBD as standard. On the other hand, its high end product is equipped with new facilities like automatic headlamps, non-LED daytime running lights and an Electrochromatic inside rear view mirror. As for the safety, side and curtain airbags are now available in the Titanium AT version, which takes the security levels to a newer heights.The only disappointing fact about this new version is that its cabin design is carried forward from the outgoing version. Being a sub 4-meter SUV, one would expect it to have a smaller cabin. But its cabin space has surprised everyone, thanks to the engineers efforts to design its interiors with restricted dimensions. In terms of technical specifications, this SUV is still available with three different engine choices. One of those is the critically acclaimed 1.0-litre EcoBoost petrol mill, which is powerful and fuel efficient as well. This mill is now available for selection on two trims like Titanium and Trend+. The other two motors are 1.5-litre Ti-VCT petrol and 1.5-litre TDCi diesel, whose transmission duties are handled by a manual transmission. Among these, the latter one has been tuned to enhance its power output to a 98.59bhp, that eventually contributed towards improvement in its fuel efficiency. Currently, it is leading the compact SUV segment in India with highest number of sales, and the recently launched Mahindra TUV300 hardly creating any impact.The fascinating exterior styling has gone to the next level, thanks to the minor cosmetic tweaks made to it. As we can see, its front profile gets revised headlamps with signature guide lamps. Also there are non-LED daytime running lights placed on the front bumper that amplifies its dynamic stance. This is perhaps the only update given to the front facade. On the sides, its skid plates gets a new new design augmenting its sporty characteristics. The designers have come up with an impeccable job with the overall dimensions and have left no stone unturned to carve it into a sensation. This 5-seater SUV has got a tall stance that makes it more influencing. Its frontage has a wide radiator grille with thick chrome stripe borders that make it look big upfront, while the bold appearing grille has the company emblem resting in the center. The aggressive façade of this vehicle has massive front bumper with a huge 3-layered air dam. Just alongside the air dam there are attractively carved chrome encircled fog lamps. The angular headlamps are a perfect match up for this kind of phenomenal frontage. The raised hood provides a macho and mature stance to the SUV, while at the sides the huge front wheel fenders align well to the A pillar making it look properly merged. Also the pair of body colored ORVMs with engraved turn indicators makes the most of this appealing suave vehicle. Though the door handles are kept simple, but the striking silver color roof rails manage to enhance the side profile. The wheels are 16-inch alloys and have been kept the same \u2018dazzling' as seen at the display at Auto Expo 2012. The rear has atypical looking C pillar that appears somewhat like the A pillar, which we generally see in SUVs. The rear wind screen glass has integrated spoiler, whereas the bumper comes in semi-black mode making it look wonderful. What's more, the further attraction at rear is the mounted spare wheel at the exquisite tail gate that authorizes it as a proper SUV. The tail lamps are made of clear glass and are stretched to provide the sporty feel of the SUV way till the end corner.Exterior Measurements:The designers at the manufacturer have very astutely carved the exterior of the compact SUV, making it appear no smaller than any SUV on the road. The overall dimensional length is 3999 mm long, while the total width is about 1765 mm. Moreover the height measures a good 1708 mm which is impressive due to its upright nature. The wheel base measures a good 2520 mm alongside a decent ground clearance of 200mm.Ed's take:\u000a The interior styling of the Ecosport is similar to that of the Fiesta, with a cockpit like design.\u000a It's not at all a hidden fact that one will find anything boring in this SUV, and the flattering plushness inside is a solid proof of the same. As soon as you enter the cabin it's hard to believe that such compact vehicle, as seen from outside, carries this huge space within; courtesy smart interior designers of the manufacturer. The interiors especially the first row has many similarities with the existing Fiesta sedan. The seating position for every individual is pretty comfortable as the posh seats come covered with decent upholstery. At front, the dash that has dark shadow grey/silver and charcoal black amalgamation, witnesses smooth surfaces and is made up of standard quality material. The interior finish that includes audio bezel, air vent rings, steering wheel spoke shell, door trim applique and gear shifter comes painted in sunset silver, which gives a fresh every time cabin is visited. The driver's seat has height adjustment and lumbar support feature, followed by drivers arm rest, leather wrapped gear knob and leather draped cozy steering wheel. These commendable aspects make the driver feel convenient and confident on the drive and alongside provide an elevated stance to the driver. For the soothing view there is cool \u2018Ice Blue' back light illumination in analogue dials and other meters at dash. There are as many as 20 small/large stowage spaces inside the cabin for the occupants to keep their knick-knack. Furthermore the two 12V power outlets are provided each at front and rear row. Some more utilities include front seats map pockets, sunglass holder, passenger vanity mirror with light and under passenger seat storage . The rear seats have option of 60/40 split and 100% fold down. If one considers the usual 346L boot space less, than it can be increased up to big 705L.Interior Comfort:A wide range of features are packed in latest launch that promise passenger comfort to a large extent. The new additions in it include rain sensing front wipers and automatic headlamps. Also, electrochromic mirrors are introduced, which deflects the light beam from following vehicles so that, it can reduce obstruction to drivers. The SYNC with AppLink is retained, which is an advanced in-car connectivity system. This is useful to control phone, entertainment as well as apps using simple voice commands. This list further consists of an efficient air conditioner unit with heater, which allows to regulate temperature. The steering column is adjustable and telescopic for better drivability with minimal effort . The ORVMs are electrically adjustable and have turn indicators placed in them. Its four windows are power adjustable along with one touch up and down on driver's side. Moreover distance to empty, average fuel economy display and outside temperature display leads to more convenience.Interior Measurements:The interior of this vehicle holds unexpectedly huge amount of space that is capable to fit in as many as 5 medium sized individuals. There is adequate head room, leg room, shoulder room and knee room for all the occupants inside. Besides occupants space there is fantastic amount of boot space for the luggage and belongings. The boot space measures about 346 liters and can be extended up to a large 705 liters. The rear seat can be split 60:40, while the rear seat cushion comes with 100% fold down feature making way for more space.Ed's take:\u000a The acceleration produced by the Ecosport is good and we like the way the Ecoboost engine performs.\u000a As this vehicle looks sporty and raring to go from outside, it is made to practically prove the same when it comes to acceleration and pick-up. The different choice of motors coupled with fine transmissions in the form of 5-speed and 6-speed manual/automatic gearboxes lets you feel high with quick acceleration and gripping top speed. The turbocharged EcoBoost petrol mill with dual VVT is capable of reaching a top speed of 160 kmph, while it can get to the 0-100 kmph in just over 12 seconds. The 1.5L Ti-VCT petrol power-plant, which also powers the Fiesta, catches the 0 to 100 kmph mark in mere about 13.25 seconds along with the top speed of 168 kmph. Furthermore the 1.5L DV5 mill is been gifted with the potential to attain the 0 to 100 kmph mark in a mere 13.2 seconds, whereas it has all the abilities to enjoy a top speed of 175 kmph.Ed's take:\u000a The engine and performance of the Ecoboost and the other two engines is good. The Ecoboost definitely having an edge in performance.\u000a Besides the elite and exemplary design inside-out the manufacturer has left no stone unturned in providing the under hood with some rare technological advancements in the form of refined and reliable motor choices. The 1.0L, 999cc EcoBoost, 3-cylinder petrol powertrain generates a big 125 PS of maximum power at 6000 rpm together with a peak torque of 170 Nm at 1400-4500 rpm . This globally acclaimed motor is coupled with a 5-speed manual transmission. Likewise the 1.5L, 1499cc Ti-VCT petrol motor produces a decent 112 PS of raw power at 6300 rpm alongside peak torque of 140 Nm at 4400 rpm. This mill is offered with the option of 5-speed manual and 6-speed automatic transmission (AT) gearbox. Lastly, its 1.5L, 4-cylinder, 1498cc DV5 mill generates a max power of 91 PS at 3750 rpm and peak high torque of 204 Nm at 2000-2750 rpm. This motor too is mated to the 5-speed manual gearbox for smoother driving.Ed's take\u000a : The fuel efficiency of the Ecosport is good, especially that of the diesel. It returns about 14-15km/l, just like the Fiesta.\u000a The American automaker respects the prime concerns of its Indian car buyers and hence uses such technology that is economical in every aspect. Here too, with it comes with power-trains that are fuel efficient irrespective of the fuel option. The 1.5L Ti-VCT petrol mill with manual transmission is capable of providing a mileage ranging from 11.0 kmpl of 15.85 kmpl. Whereas the updated 1.5L DV5 oil, which also carries manual gearbox, delivers a decent mileage of 22.27 kmpl. Likewise the Eco-friendly and acclaimed 999cc Ecoboost petrol engine too churns out truly reasonable figures in the fuel efficiency column with 18.88 kmpl. Now this is definitely as per the promise from the manufacturer, which said 20% more fuel efficiency than conventional petrol mills.Ed's take:\u000a The most powerful engine on offer is the EcoBoost and it does feel like a 120bhp engine, and the figures are for real.\u000a The 1.0L EcoBoost 3-cylinder petrol powertrain produces a huge 123.37bhp of maximum power along with the peak torque of 170Nm. The other 4-cylinder petrol motor, the 1499cc Ti-VCT generates 110bhp of utmost power together with peak torque of 140 Nm at 4400 rpm. This mill comes with the choice of 5-speed manual and 6-speed automatic transmission gearbox. Moreover everyone's favorite diesel version is packed with a 4-cylinder 1498cc DV5 powertrain that pours out a maximum power of 98.59bhp and high torque of 205Nm.Ed's take:\u000a The Ecosport is loaded with several brownies and not just must haves like SYNC is something absolutely new to the Indian car market.\u000a Being one of a kind compact SUV the American automaker has bestowed it with some class leading entertainment systems in order to ensure leisurely long drives. This compact SUV comes with 2-line Multi-Functional Display (MFD) screen, while in the mid and top variants it is loaded with 3.5 inch MFD screen. For more entertainment there is stereo system with FM/AM Radio, Aux-in, USB interface alongside CD/MP3 player. To get the relaxing music heard there are in all 4 speakers, (2 front + 2 rear) and 2 tweeters at front . In addition to latest version Bluetooth there is modern \u2018SYNC' feature that takes the control of voice, as seen in the Fiesta sedan, making phone calls in-check. In addition 'SYNC', which comes in with partnership from Microsoft, comes handy during any emergency situation. The multi-functional steering wheel that has mounted audio and phone control switches further adds to effortlessness and practicality of this superlative SUV.Ed's take:\u000a Fords are known for their handling and the Ecosport is no different. The chassis is flexible and does drive well on bad roads and even on bends.\u000a The braking and handling has never been an issue till date. And as a result with this SUV too it continues the same reign, although one may feel that the brand has gone a notch higher in this aspect. Apart from getting tested on brilliant grip on the road the vehicle has also been scrutinized on the braking, suspension and handling part and has received better results. Here the front suspension has Independent McPherson strut with coil spring and anti-roll bar , while there is Semi-independent twist beam with twin gas and oil filled shock absorbers at the rear. Moreover the brakes at front have ventilated disc and rear has drum brakes. The braking and suspension is up to the mark and better than any stalwart SUVs running on the roads, but still the handing on corners at high speeds requires attention.Ed's take:\u000a The safety features on the Ecoboost is good and has six airbags, which no other SUV in this segment offers.\u000a The manufacturer has ensured maximum passenger safety in this new version by incorporating it with a wide array of features. It has offered remote central locking with flip key, while a locking wheel nut is also given for a spare wheel. The immobilizer system doesn't let the engine start unless it is inserted with the right key. The anti lock braking system and electronic brake force distribution, both improves its braking mechanism besides preventing it from skidding. There are dual front, side and curtain airbags offered, which altogether aids in avoiding any possible injury in the event of an accident. Also, it comes with emergency brake hazard warning, rear parking sensors, defogger, high mount stop lamp, configurable speed alarm in its fuel computer, seat belts for all passengers, emergency brake assist, as well as ISOFIX child seat fixing points that add to the security quotient. The top end trim in specific, additionally gets a few more advanced aspects like electronic stability control, hill launch assist and traction control systems that guarantees a risk free driving experience.This compact SUV is available with both steel and alloy wheels depending on the variants. The base and mid range options are fitted with a set of 15 inch steel rims. These are further covered with tubeless tyres of size 195/65 R15 that assure a firm grip and excellent performance on any surface. Meanwhile, the others in its lineup are equipped with a set of stylish 16 inch alloy wheels, whose radial tyres bear the size 205/60 R16. Not just this, but a spare wheel is also affixed to tailgate, which turns out useful in case a tyre goes flat.1. Formidable yet elegant exterior appearance makes it standout of the crowd.2. Plush interiors loaded with good features gives it clear edge on its rivals.3. It offers options to choose from different drive-trains. 1. Boot Space is on the downside.2. The appearance of being a bigger version of hatchback works against it.3. This model's limited availability of service centers in the country is a big minus for this SUV.

Also, they have 15-spoke design alloy wheels, which renders a sporty appeal.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis eleventh generation model is built with an improved wheelbase of 100mm that eventually contributes for creating more leg space inside. It also comes with some improvements regarding its length, width and height making it bigger than its predecessor. As far as the interiors are concerned, its cockpit houses a newly designed dashboard equipped with advanced functions and facilities. Its cabin has an aura of majesty, thanks to the extensive metallic inserts embodying various corners of the sedan. Its cabin has a beige and piano black colored scheme, which is another eye-soothing factor.

Currently, this sedan comes with a standard warranty of 100000 kilometers or up to 3 years.The current generation Corolla Altis has an aerodynamic body structure making it look far more advanced than its predecessors. Its front facade is obviously the most attractive part of this sedan owing to its magnificent radiator grille and sleek headlamps. The radiator grille is garnished with chrome and is further embedded with a company logo in the center. Flanking this is the headlight cluster integrated with automatic LED headlamps and day time running lights. The bumper is garnished in body color and houses a wider air intake section for engine cooling. It is also affixed with a body colored under-guard for additional protection.

Its minimum ground clearance is about 175mm. Its overall length is 4620mm, total height is 1475mm and width measures about 1775mm (including both external rear view mirrors).Ed's Take:\u000a The interior of the new Corolla Altis is contemporary and definitely refreshed when compared to the previous generation. The quality and the space too are good.\u000a Its recently launched limited edition Corolla Altis gets minor updates with regards to the looks. It gets leather seat covers embedded with 'Limited' logo on them. This version also gets illuminated scuff plats along with puddle lamps that can project the brand's logo. Adding to this, we can find faux wood inserts in some parts of the cockpit. Besides these, no other changes have been done to the sedan.

The base variant is equipped with a manual HVAC unit, while other variants get an automatic air conditioner that cools the cabin quickly. The AC vents are in rectangular shape and placed at both end of the dashboard for better air circulation. The cruise control function is available in high end trim only. The company has also given this variant a number of storage aspects like front personal lamp with storage, rear center armrest with cup holder, door map pockets, front seat back pockets and a large glove box. It also has a couple of 12V power socket in center console for charging mobiles and other electronic devices.

The car maker has increased the wheelbase by 100mm to a total of 2700mm now, which has created ample leg space in the cabin. It has a spacious boot compartment, which can be increased by folding rear seat.Ed's Take:\u000a The Corolla Altis petrol has good acceleration, while one has to put in efforts to extract maximum power from the diesel. It could have been better on the diesel, especially when the competition is offering powerful diesels.\u000a Its petrol variants with a six speed manual transmission gear box can zoom towards a top speed of 190 Kmph and can break the 100 Kmph speed mark in the range of 9 to 10.42 seconds from a standstill. Its automatic variants also have the same top speed, but the pickup figure ranges between 11 to 13 seconds. As for the diesel versions, their top speed ranges between 160 to 170 Kmph and the pickup from 0 to 100 Kmph speed mark can be achieved in 13 to 14 seconds.Ed's Take:\u000a The performance of the Corolla Altis is good. Not the best in class, but definitely very smooth and refined mills that perform well.\u000a The petrol variants are equipped with a powerful 1.8-litre power plant that is based on a dual VVT-i technology. It is integrated with 4-cylinders and 16-valves using DOHC based valve configuration. It has the ability to displace 1798cc and can churn out a peak power output of 138.08bhp at 6400rpm in combination with a maximum torque of 173Nm at 4000rpm. The petrol motor is cleverly mated with both 6-speed manual and 7-speed super CVT-i sequential shiftmatic transmission gearbox, which sends the engine power to its front wheels. The diesel trim is powered by a sophisticated 1.4-litre D-4D engine, which comes with a displacement capacity of 1364cc. It is incorporated with a turbocharger and an intercooler, which improves its durability. It can generate 87.2bhp of power at 3800rpm that results in a peak torque output of 205Nm between 1800 to 2800rpm. The company has skilfully coupled this diesel mill with a 6-speed manual transmission gearbox.Ed's Take:\u000a The Toyota Corolla Altis is known for its high fuel efficiency, not only on the diesel but even on the petrol. This has been the character of the Corolla and it gets carried forward on the new Altis also.\u000a The petrol trims draw power from a 1798cc engine that has an EFI (electronic fuel injection) supply system. This enables the motor to deliver a mileage ranging from 9.5 Kmpl to 14.53 Kmpl. However, this drive-train with automatic gearbox can generate a maximum mileage of 13.5 Kmpl. Its other oil-burner is an 1364cc mill integrated with a common rail direct injection system. This power train can give away a maximum mileage of 21.43 Kmpl.Ed's Take:\u000a The Corolla Altis has good power on offer, especially the petrol as it is highly fuel-efficient too, despite being a 1.8-litre. The diesel doesn\u2019t get an auto.\u000a The 1.8-litre petrol drive-train can generate a maximum power of 138.08bhp in combination with 173Nm of commanding torque output. While the 1.4-litre D-4D motor houses a turbocharging unit within. This motor is capable of producing 87.1bhp that results in a peak torque of 205Nm.Ed's Take:\u000a The Corolla Altis has been loaded with all the must have features by Toyota. Hence, it fulfills the needs of the buyer with touchscreen infotainment. \u000a The newly launched Limited Edition trims also have the touchscreen infotainment system, but they are incorporated with a Smartphone enabled navigation system along with gesture controls for more convenience. As for the other versions, they have an advanced infotainment system that supports CD/MP3 player, radio and provides connectivity for Aux-in port and USB sockets. It also supports Bluetooth connectivity, which allows the users to pair their phones and enables call function. The base variant has a 5.8-inch LCD touchscreen display, while other trim gets a 7.1-inch touchscreen audio system that features a navigation system as well. The top end variants are also bestowed with a rear view camera along with reverse parking sensors that provides excellent assistance to the driver while parking. The base variant lacks many features, but buyers can customize it with exciting aspects like vibrant seat covers, premium quality upholstery, floor mats, rear parking camera, navigation system, mud guard covers, body graphics and alloy wheels.Ed's Take:\u000a The handling characteristics of the Corolla Altis is good and even the ride is composed and smooth.\u000a The automaker has equipped this latest version with an efficient braking mechanism. The front wheels are fitted with a set of ventilated disc brakes, while the rear ones are paired with a set of conventional disc brakes. It is further assisted by anti lock braking system along with electronic brake force distribution system. This sedan is further equipped with electronic stability program that reinforces its stability. When it comes to suspension system, it is quite efficient and helps in keeping the vehicle well balanced. The front axle is affixed with a McPherson strut and the rear one is assembled with a torsion beam. This mechanism enables it to deal with all the jerks caused on roads and offers a comfortable driving experience. It is incorporated with a highly responsive power assisted steering system that has tilt and telescopic adjustment function that helps in smoother handling, while supporting the minimum turning radius of 5.4 meters.Ed's Take:\u000a The safety features on the Corolla Altis are ABS with EBD and even airbags.\u000a This model series is loaded with a large number of safety aspects in order to ensure maximum protection to its occupants. There are dual stage front airbags available for driver and co-passenger, which safeguards them in case of any accident. It comes with anti-lock braking system along with electronic brake force distribution, which futher enhances the braking mechanism and prevents the vehicle from skidding. Its electronic engine immobilizer system avoids unauthorized entry into the vehicle. In addition to these, it has a central locking system, high mount third brake light, door ajar warning lamp and driver seat belt notification.The car maker is offering the top end variant of model series with a set of stylish 16 inch multi spoke alloy wheels These rims are covered with 205/55 R16 sized tubeless radial tyres. The J and JS trims have been equipped with a set of 15 inch steel wheels affixed with full wheel caps. While the remaining variants have alloy wheels of same size.

VIn India, there are automobile manufacturers and there is \u000aMaruti\u000a . Be it the thirst to have a native automobile manufacturer or the unbeatable service stations all across the country, the company always hit the right notes with Indian automobile audience. Every car it launches has the same amount of curiosity and when the product finally launches, the crowd find themselves applauding. The reason is a simple fact that this company never actually took Indian customers for granted. Inspite of constant customer base, they strived hard in bringing some of the very innovative automobile design parameters to the country. While maintaining the iconic models the company created over the years, it went on to produce more iconic vehicles whose ubiquitous appeal helps them attain a cult status relatively quicker than others. The 800, the Omni and the Alto, these are just some of the few vehicles, which registered their place with any individual who is aware of the automobile industry of the country. After launching such iconic vehicles, indisputably the most successful family commuter remains to be the Omni. With its iconic sliding doors and a capacity to handle 8 passengers with ease, it instantly became a sought after choice for large families which India is renowned for. But the changing times force even the most sought after vehicles to think a step ahead and offer an alternative so that the vehicle remains iconic and customer is provided a choice to opt for a much contemporary vehicle. Volkswagen faced it, Mini Cooper faced it and in Indian market, this acclaimed manufacturer faced it too. So it opted to leave the Omni intact without any change and launched an new vehicle, which would cater the needs of contemporary customers. The alternative was the Versa. But after a lot of efforts by the renowned car maker, they ultimately decided to launch this model, the \u000aEeco\u000a which reflected its contemporary design architecture not just in its name but also in its truly Eco-friendly functioning and an advanced exterior framework, which bears no resemblance to the Omni and hence acts as a true distinct product. The latest version is offered in a five seater design also has an AC, while the seven seater version offers a great comfort for even larger families. A CNG kit is added in the car's CNG five seater AC version. The model also comes with a powerful 1196cc BS-IV compliant engine. The fuel competency of the vehicle is enhanced by the engine management system of the engine, which ultimately succeeds in being a perfect solution for Indian roads as it also offers an amazing 15.1 Kmpl mileage. The company also succeeded in offering the vehicle in a refreshing look, which does compete with both the routine transportation vehicles as well as SUVs and MUVs, while maintaining its highly affordable pricing. The 1196cc engine runs on petrol which makes the output power obviously competitive. With 73bhp at 6000rpm, this car also offers equally competitive torque of 101Nm at 3000rpm. Being an environmental friendly car at its core, it offers spacious interiors also to match its comforting exterior conscious. The whole structure is simple with a less nuisance about additional embellishments in the external framework. Evidently, the manufacturer means business with this model and its design reassures its stand on the same. The five speed manual transmission allows the vehicle to maneuver through different speeds with ease. The CNG variant, however is designed in a bi-fuel mode, so that the vehicle can run on both petrol as well as CNG. The interesting part is the fact that both fuels use the same 1200cc engine, so there would not be a significant difference in performance and comfort. The CNG mode however can only cater an output of 63bhp at 6000rpm and the torque produced by the mode is an equally decent 84Nm at 3000 rpm. The Intelligent Gas Port Injection bi fuel technology, dubbed as i-GPI, helps in increasing the fuel economy and offering safety, which would have been compromised when the same CNG kits are installed by customers individually from other sources. The factory fitted CNG kit also provides a genuine affair where any further issues can be resolved by a reliable source, the company itself. There is something distinct about this car be it the elegant exterior design or the uber cool interior design or even the really satisfying performance. Offering revolutionary products like Omni, this seems to be the perfect successor to the iconic vehicle. As a new update to the growing market demands, the manufacturer released the 'Smiles' variant, which offers a few advanced tweaks in the interiors as well as exteriors as a very affordable price. By giving in some additional money, customers can avail a new level of luxury with advanced 2-Din music system with USB, a pair of powerful 15 cm speakers, dual tone seat covers, a set of durable black floor mats for interiors and stylish full wheel covers, mud flaps and an exclusive 'Smiles' stickers on the body, which gives the truly exquisite feel of this limited edition. This model too is however available in both petrol and CNG options.

As per reports doing rounds over internet, this stunning car is most likely to enter the Indian car market by this year end. Already several units of this model have been imported in the country and this is an indication that it may be launched very soon. Most probably, it will be introduced through the completely built unit (CBU) channel. When launched, it may compete with MINI Cooper, Fiat Abarth 595 Competizione and a few others in this segment. This car might come with a few enhancements in terms of features yet, it sticks to the same classy styling that is reminiscent to the original one. In comparison to the outgoing version, it may be more sportier and muscular. It is said that the car's length is slightly increased, and it will also be lower as well as wider in terms of dimensions. No other details about its exteriors are out now, and we can expect it to carry standard elements. Some of these include a wide air intake section at front surrounded by a couple of fog lamps and the trendy headlight cluster, which is for sure an attraction in its front facade. What's going to dominate its side profile are the flared up wheel arches and a modish set of alloy wheels with tubeless radial tyres.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLooking at its pictures, it can be easily said that the rear end looks sporty and distinctive compared to other vehicles in this segment. There is a sloping roof line and a spoiler is also integrated. As of now, there is no information about what all attributes it may include inside the cabin. But in terms of internal space, we can certainly expect it to be better than before considering the change in its dimensions.

When it comes to safety, it may be incorporated with vital aspects like anti-lock braking system, electronic stabilization program, front seat belts with pre-tensioners, child safety locks, central locking system and many more. On the other hand, this upcoming car may be powered by a 1.4-litre TSI petrol engine that is currently doing duty in the Jetta sedan. It is likely to be more fuel efficient and generates nearly 120bhp power in combination with 200Nm torque. According to the sources, it will be introduced without diesel engine option and one can expect for it only in coming days.The bug shape of this hatchback is what makes it unique compared to various other models running in the market today. It has a charisma which has been enhanced over the years with its evolving generations. The curves, bulging wheel arches and \u201chappy face\u201d like front design can make the heads turn at the very first glance itself. It has a retro styling and despite a few changes, it stays true to its original self. This latest version is said to be more muscular and angular compared to its predecessor. Its front facade will have a wide windscreen fitted with intermittent wipers, while the prominent company's insignia is embossed at the tip of its bonnet. The design of bumper and headlight cluster just go well with its overall structure. On the sides, the outside mirrors may have side turn blinkers integrated to it, whereas the pronounced wheel arches might get a stylish set of alloy wheels. Meanwhile, its rear end seems to be more interesting and attractive. It looks more curvy this time, which will only add to its appearance. Trendy tail lamps, expressive boot lid, bumper and a windscreen will be the aspects in its rear end, meanwhile, a sporty spoiler can also be expected.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aExterior Measurements:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe reports say that its total length is further increased, while the dimensions of its width and height might also be altered. Its wheelbase may be quite good and this will only indicate better space inside.This car maker has ensured excellent interior quality and finish in all its models. So, we can expect the same in this soon to be launched vehicle also. High quality plastic material may be used inside the cabin, and there is no idea about its color scheme yet. This hatch might be surely bestowed with well cushioned seats covered with fine leather upholstery. The front seats may come with electrical adjustment functions along with lumbar support as well. These may be integrated with headrests and offer great thigh and back support too. The driver seat may be height adjustable and this makes sure that the driver is always in a comfortable position and has the best view of the road. The cockpit might carry the contemporary design, which will give a rich look to its interiors. The dashboard is anticipated to house more sophisticated elements like a proficient AC unit, music system and a steering wheel, which can also have tilt and telescopic adjustment functions. There might also be sunglass holder, cup and bottle holders, accessory sockets and a few storage spaces on the offer for added convenience.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInterior Comfort:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt is anticipated to come with a number of practical features that may provide enhanced comfort to its occupants.

Besides these, many other features can be anticipated like cabin lights, air vents, high quality speakers, low fuel warning and so on.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInterior Measurements:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis small car is expected to have a roomy internal section. The legroom seems to be quite sufficient, but the space in the rear may not be that good. Even the head room may become problematic especially for tall passengers. Coming to the boot space, it might be good enough to place ample luggage.The manufacturer might most probably couple its engine with a 7-speed DSG automatic transmission gear box. This will distribute power to its front wheels and even boosts overall performance.This latest model from the car maker will most likely be powered with a 1.4-litre, petrol engine. This is said to be the same motor which is currently incorporated in the popular Jetta sedan. It might have four cylinders that are further integrated with 16 valves. This mill may come with a turbocharged stratified injection system and could be paired with a seven speed DSG automatic transmission gear box, which distributes power to its front wheels. As per the sources, it might belt out a peak power of 120bhp and at the same time, yield torque output of 200Nm.Right now, there is no information available about the fuel economy its engine can return on both highways and city roads.This TSI petrol motor may churn out a peak power of 120bhp and at the same time, it might deliver torque output of 200Nm.It may be bestowed with an advanced music system that is integrated in the center console.

VOver the years, Mahindra has established itself as an SUV specialist. With a line-up that includes everything from a rugged and utilitarian Bolero to a plush and modern XUV500, Mahindra wants to make sure there\u2019s an SUV for every kind of customer. With the NuvoSport, Mahindra will be looking to plug the gap between the KUV100 and the TUV300. The NuvoSport is essentially a re-styled version of Mahindra\u2019s first sub 4 metre SUV, the Quanto.The NuvoSport is a sub 4 metre compact SUV, based on the Quanto, which in-turn was based on the Xylo. However, it now shares it's platform with the new Scorpio. The design is a last ditch attempt at salvaging the Quanto and is typically Mahindra (read: quirky). The most noticeable change is the updated face. The Xylo look alike fascia has been ditched in favour of a more aggressive and \u2018in your face\u2019 styling. The split headlamps are sure to grab some attention. The daytime running lights form an \u2018eyebrow\u2019 over the main lamps, which we think looks rather cool. The updated bumper brings some brawn to the profile. Mahindra has stuck to the tried and tested formula of using matte black appliques and a silver skidplate for the SUV look. The side and the rear remains relatively unchanged. Changes that immediately catch the eye are the updated 16\u201d alloy wheels and the new tail-lamps. Other than these, the NuvoSport remains identical to the outgoing Quanto.While the interiors look identical to the Quanto in terms of design, Mahindra has infused certain modern elements to keep it up to speed with the times. It gets a new black and grey color palette which looks rather dull. We\u2019d have loved to see an all-black interior or maybe even a beige and black combo. Updates to the interior include a new 6.2-inch touchscreen audio system with Bluetooth, USB and FM support. The system is the exact same Kenwood unit found in the Ssangyong Rexton SUV. The controls for the air-conditioning system have also been replaced with circular knobs. Mahindra could have included an automatic climate control for the price. Both, the Vitara Brezza and the Ford EcoSport offer automatic climate control. The steering is now identical to the one on the TUV300 and features mounted controls. The steering can be adjusted for rake. The NuvoSport continues to be a 7-seater, just like its predecessor. Only the TUV300 gets a similar 5+2 seating arrangement. Space in the first two rows are more than adequate, with legroom and headroom being generous. The jump seats in the third row are best left to kids. You can even fold the jump seats down and recline the second row. This will be a boon on those long road-trips. Speaking of road-trips, the boot is rated at 412-litres. It can be further extended by using the 60:40 split on the rear bench. Tuck the rear seats away altogether, and what you get is 850-litres of space. There are plenty of storage spaces around the cabin too. For instance, there are a couple of cupholders near the gear-lever, bottle holders in the doorpads and even a nifty sunglass holder. Overall, the  NuvoSport does feature a really practical interior. It scores high on space and equipment offered. However, quality isn\u2019t the best around. The Vitara Brezza and the Ford EcoSport both feel better built. The engine is the same as the one on the TUV. However, it runs a different tune with better specs on paper when compared to the TUV. The change is not really astronomical. The engine has been badged the mHAWK 100. With 100bhp and 240Nm on tap, it is the most powerful compact SUV on sale today. The engine has an eco option where the engine is toned down to 73bhp & 180Nm of torque that keeps the fuel economy in check. The Ford Ecosport comes in a very close second at 99bhp/215Nm.In terms of the all important fuel consumption, the NuvoSport\u2019s ARAI efficiency stands at 17.45kmpl.The torque kicks in at a relatively low 1600rpm. This help get a move on in bumper to bumper traffic. The other thing that will assist you is the relatively light clutch.The other option is to pickup the NuvoSport without a clutch as it is on offer in an AMT (Automatic) variant. As most AMT\u2019s are plagued with the issue of delayed shifts, we weren\u2019t surprised when the issue appeared in the NuvoSport too. Don\u2019t drive the NuvoSport too enthusiastically and it will keep you happy.What is one of the biggest improvements is the ride & handling. The NuvoSport\u2019s chassis is based on the Scorpio.When compared to the Quanto, the NuvoSport sees improvement in terms of dynamics. With an updated suspension, the body roll is now in check and the car inspires a lot more confidence when compared to its predecessor.The noise levels too are an improvement. The engine is smooth and the amount of noise filtering into the cabin is in check.As to how the NuvoSport takes on the rough surfaces and speed bumps that you face on a daily basis, we\u2019re going to hold our verdict till the point when we get our hands on it for a comprehensive drive.Just like Mahindra\u2019s latest offerings, we expect ABS & EBD to be standard across the range. Dual airbags will be optional with every variant.The NuvoSport is an attractive package, especially for the people looking for a comfortable city runner. The updated design is catchy and the upgrades to the chassis and suspension puts it miles ahead of the Quanto. It also has oodles of space on the inside and an upgraded safety list.We only got a chance to take the NuvoSport out for a short spin and we\u2019ll come back to you after our comprehensive drive. On the surface, this package sure looks promising.

And those with CNG takes close to 7-8 seconds to reach this mark from scratch. A high speed of nearly 135 to 140 Kmph can be reached by it.Editor's take : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe K10 engine on the Alto is frugal and also has good performance.

This is thanks to the K-Series engine series from Maruti Suzuki.\u000a \u000a \u000a \u000a It is equipped with a K10B motor and it is based on a multi point fuel injection system. This enables to return approximately 22 Kmpl under city conditions and on the highways this increases to nearly 24.07 Kmpl. Under CNG mode, it delivers a mileage of 32.26 Km/Kg and this is very resourceful and affordable.Editor's take : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe Alto previously was powered by a 800cc engine, the new 1.0-litre engine has boosted its performance.\u000a A petrol mill is incorporated in this carrying three cylinders and twelve valves that are based on double overhead camshaft valve configuration. It has a capacity to produce a maximum power of 67.1bhp at 6000rpm and can produce a peak torque output of 90Nm at 3500rpm. Whereas, when shifted to the other mode, it generates 58.2bhp in combination with 78Nm torque.It has an advanced audio unit that supports multiple players comprising a CD and an MP3 player. It also has USB port and a radio tuner with antenna fitted to the roof for its support. Two speakers are offered for the sake of sound distribution. The buyer can customize it with a few accessories based on the requirement. More features like fancy decals can be used to make the external appearance much attractive. Also, components like floor mats, leather upholstery, fabric inserts to inside doors and music system can be selected. Roof rails and roof spoilers can be included to improvise the style of the vehicle. Airbags and parking sensors can be integrated for improving the safety quotient.Editor's take : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe ride on the Alto is soft, yet most of the jolts filter into the cabin, due to the small tyre size. The handling of the Alto is good enough and even zipping through busy streets isn\u2019t difficult.\u000a This series is equipped with an efficient braking and suspension mechanism too. The front wheels have a set of ventilated discs and its rear wheels are fixed with the drum brakes. The suspension comprises of gas filled McPherson strut to its front axle and a three link rigid axle type is used for the other one. The steering is highly responsive and has a minimum turning radius of 4.6 meters.Editor's take : \u000a \u000a \u000aThe Alto misses out on features like dual airbags, and at the moment only Alto 800 and Eon have these features as optional.\u000a It has been equipped with a lot of significant components to ensure proper protection of its occupants as well as of the vehicle. The VXi (O) comes with a driver airbag that is a plus point. Besides this, it is built using lightweight steel including side impact protection beams and crumple zones. The LX has headlight leveling device, and three point seat belts for all with a 2-point fixed seat belt for rear center passenger. Then there is a high mounted third stop lamp as well affixed above the windscreen. It also has driver's seat belt warning lamp, a pair of fog lamps, a set of ventilated disc brakes and child locks increases the level of protection.All these are adorned with a set of steel wheels that are of size 13 inches. These are covered with full wheel covers in the high range trims. These rims are covered with a set of radial tubeless tyres of size 155/65 R13.1. Affordable price range that suits the masses.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a2. Exterior cosmetics and internal aspects are refined.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a3. Addition of the automatic gear box will certainly boost its sales.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a4. Spare parts and maintenance cost is quite reasonable.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a5. The mileage is at par with other contenders in this segment. 1. Absence of alloy wheels even in its top end version.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a2. Lesser ground clearance can be a hindrance sometimes.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a3. More security and convenient aspects can be added.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a4. None of them have advanced braking mechanisms like ABS.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a5. Very little luggage space.

VOverall:\u000a\u000aAudi had propelled itself to a whole new stage with this daring new release. The R8 sits among the top legion of sports cars, rivalling high-wired machines such as Maserati and Ferrari. The vehicle has some of the most brazen features imaginable, from a mouth-watering exterior profile to the most intense performance capacity. And just when you thought that it couldn't get any better, a new version of the model is released. The recently launched V10 Plus is the sole variant of the model series here in India, and we're here to plunge into it to chart out its strengths and weaknesses. \u000a\u000a\u000aPros:\u000a\u000a1. Visionary exterior format, sure to have every car lover's attention. \u000a2. Here's a car whose handling you'd love, despite its death-defying speed capacities. \u000a\u000aCons:\u000a\u000a1. The cabin is deprived of space. \u000a\u000a2. Lack of luxury and comfort facilities is sure to get many customers dismayed. \u000a\u000aStand-Out Features:\u000a\u000a1. Its performance makes it one of the world's most powerful super-cars, and this is sure to bring it some good votes. \u000a2. The cabin and seating arrangement ensure that you're kept in a comfortable, pleasant air throughout. \u000a\u000aOverall:\u000a\u000aThe R8 is one of the rare super-cars that effectively blend style and performance. When you take a look at the machine from the outside, you feel a majestic aura emanate from the soothing lines, the hawk-like stance and the opulent design elements. Its outfit has been sculpted with an eye on agility and speed, and this adds to the exterior splendour. The new version comes with some minor, noticeable changes to the cosmetics, including curved contours and a strong shoulder line that invigorate the side, along with a honey-comb pattern front grille along with LED headlamps. The race style cockpit keeps you in optimal comfort through the drive, while providing some strong entertainment features to keep you eased. The chassis and braking sections fortify its speed capacity, enabling a more balanced overall build. The recently rolled out new variant in the series, the V10 Plus, comes with some add-ons to the power and vision of the original version, and we're here to see\u000a\u000aExteriors:\u000a\u000aHere is a vehicle with an exterior cover that's nearly hypnotising. We've got to be frank with you, folks, the machine's looks place it in the same platform as models of Ferrari and Lamborghini. The sports-car realm has soaked in all of the finest design elements over years, but this model seems to have veered off the conventional, over-saturated path and tested new grounds with the body designing. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe vehicle does bear influences resonating from the mainstream sports models, but you can't deny it has its own unique spark that make it nearly jaw dropping. From the low, sharp front nose to the powerful rear, the machine has been shaped with a grace and elegance that make it almost seductive. The roofline gently streams over the cabin area, before angling in towards the bonnet and merging into it. That agile, powerful stance gives it a formidable air that few vehicles released on Indian roads have seen before. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe front face has been shaped with a predator-like vision, with the sharp headlamp clusters and the large front grille that drapes down towards the bottom of the skirt. Air openings hang on both corners of the skirts, giving the face a more harmonious outlook. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe bonnet slopes downwards with a flawless precision, and we thought that the strong curvatures mixed a feminine touch in the vehicle's masculine appeal. The gentle metallic skin of the front cloaks over the wheel arches by the side, giving them a more pronounced and muscular appearance. \u000a\u000a\u000aAs we stood by the side of the vehicle, we were taken by the low and sharp layout of the vehicle. The note of harmony in its design is clearly visible, and its agile, streamlined poise gives it a honed aerodynamic edge very rarely seen before. We thought that the single door format added to its athletic posture, while the large, black garnish at the rear makes for a more distinct impression. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe rear commands a more dynamic aura, with the more husky bearing and the air blades beneath the tail-lamps. The roof-line melts down towards the rear and shapes around a strong section, and we thought that the aesthetics of the design here were particularly good. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe slender tail-lamps are positioned atop the air blades, giving a wholesome, intact impression of the region. A short spoiler solidifies the vehicle's powerful impression. \u000a\u000a\u000aWhen you take a look at the sporty double exhaust pipes situated on both corners of the rear bumper, you feel the car's thrilling image come full circle. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aInteriors:\u000a\u000aIt's no secret that the cabin lacks space and splendour: It has been tailored solely for the purpose of a safe high speed drive. We did, however, enjoy some plush elements of design that helped to renew the atmosphere. \u000a\u000a\u000aThis new edition comes with some minor changes, including the bucket seats and a more attractive, uncluttered dashboard layout. Though the changes are not substantial, we thought that they did add some vitality to the air. \u000a\u000a\u000aWhen you step into the cabin, you can clearly tell that this is a completely driver oriented cabin, and that pretty much everything else takes a back seat in the design. The all black interiors make for a charged aura, and we thought that it reflected the car's focussed, racy outlook. \u000a\u000a\u000aAC vents sit by the corner of the dashboard. The new version comes with a 12.3-inch virtual screen that has buttons propped around it. At the base of the console, the metallic gear shifter makes adds a more sophisticated pulse to the atmosphere. \u000a\u000a\u000aThe steering wheel by the left of the dashboard inherits a classic, racing style design that really had us going. The hold of the wheel was perfect, and few people would deny the thrill of it. \u000a\u000a\u000aAligned ahead of the wheel, the instrument cluster houses a tachometer and a speedometer, and we thought the dial design was quite cool. \u000a\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, the seats have an all new 'bucket' design. You can feel yourself wrapped in comfortably during the drive, so much so that the thrust of the high speed drive doesn't bother you much. \u000a\u000a\u000aFor this new edition, customers are given the choice between Alcantara, Pearl Nappa leather upholstery and fine Nappa leather upholstery to dress the seats. In addition to this, clear coated carbon fibre appliqués can also be added to enrich the space, and we're sure that most occupants would love such small touch-ups. \u000a\u000aPerformance:\u000a\u000aThis is the facet that defines this vehicle. Its raw and electric performance capacity far outstrips most other vehicles on the road. For this version, there is no change with the engine and inner dynamics. Packed within it is a 5.2-litre V10 engine that displaces a mammoth 5204cc. Aside from this, it brings out a thundering power of 602bhp at 8250rpm. \u000a\u000a\u000aAbove the figures, it's the driving of the vehicle that would really get you crackling. A light touch on the gas pedal, and the vehicle zooms off to a powerful start. Acceleration and throttle response are amazing, and the swift sprinting capacity had us thrown back into our seats. As you cruise at higher speeds, you're sure to love the majestic sound of the V10 engine grinding. The engine power is transmitted through a highly efficient 7-speed S-tronic gearbox, which worked terrific in our opinion. The vehicle's speed capacity would send chills down an ordinary person's spine: It   roars to a top speed of 330kmph, and spurts from 0 to 100kmph in just 3.2 seconds, the time taken for a few blinks of the eye. \u000a\u000a\u000aRide and Handling:\u000a\u000aA vehicle of this might requires equally strong chassis and braking systems, and the company sees to this. The front wheels come with 8-piston brake callipers, while the rear wheels are equipped with 4-piston callipers. We thought that cornering, braking and stopping were a marvellous and strain free affair. With the massive speeds that the car takes to, however, you're likely to be thrown around slightly during swift cornering. The vehicle tackles road anomalies moderately, but one needs to note that it has been designed for high speed cruising on clean raceways, not bumbling over potholes and road bumps. Its advanced suspension arrangement includes dynamically tuned springs and shock absorbers, and this does help to ease the overall ride condition. \u000a\u000a\u000aSafety:\u000a\u000aWith a top speed of 330kmph and a acceleration rate of 3.2 seconds, the vehicle's most pivotal factor is its safety facilities. We were satisfied with the safety layout, although we did think it could have gone a notch or two up. Drive stability is reinforced with some sound aid programs, including the Anti-lock braking system, Electronic differential lock system, Anti slip regulation and Electronic stabilisation control. Aside from this, you're sure to have your fill of peace with an all encompassing airbag arrangement, an integrated head restraint system, seatbelts that come with a reminder for the front occupants and ISOFIX child seating anchors. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aVariants:\u000a\u000aHere in India, the model is released with just one variant, the V10 Plus. We think this might spare a lot of hassle to buyers in terms of choosing which variant to go for. This trim comes with a slew of good features, including a reversing camera, a cruise control function, Audi exclusive floor mats, an Audi phone box, and a garage door opener. A Bang & Olufsen sound system brings you first class entertainment, and this comes along with 13-high performance loudspeakers and a 16 channel amplifier for the most engrossing experience possible. \u000a\u000a\u000aVerdict:\u000a\u000aThis car here is a monster. It has been designed to break barriers on the road, and to raise the bar for your high speed experience. On the downside, however, it comes with a small and cramped cabin, its fuel economy could prove very expensive for you, and there are minimal comfort and entertainment facilities to ride with. And to top it all off, you have a whopping price to live with. At the end of the day, this is a one of a kind vehicle, and we'd say its suits a small niche of race enthusiastic people. For those looking for a normal vehicle that they could use in their daily lives, we'd recommend you to look elsewhere. \u000a

VMercedes-Benz GLA-Class\u000a is yet another sophisticated product from the German automobile firm that reinvented the perception of an urban SUV. It is a pure SUV with design elements of a sedan that makes it a unique contender in its league. Initially, the firm introduced this SUV series in just one trim and in later stages, its AMG version was put on offer for the Indian customers. The automobile firm classifies this luxury vehicle as a compact SUV, but its overall length measures more than 4.4-meters earning its rightful position among mid size luxury vehicles. It is currently available in three variants with one petrol and diesel engine option for the buyers to choose from. Its petrol motor is a 2.0-litre turbocharged power plant and the oil-burner is a 2.2-litre motor that is paired to a 7-speed 7G-DCT automatic transmission gearbox. This vehicle looks stunning from the insides and it resembles the silhouette of the A-Class hatchback. On the other hand, buyers have a choice to personalize the interiors with either all-beige or all-black color scheme. As for its exterior styling, this vehicle has compact structure adorned with several trademark features like bi-xenon headlamps, along with LED DRLs and a sturdy set of 18-inch alloy wheels. However, the main attraction of its appearance is its chrome plated grille that is embodied with the iconic company's insignia. This SUV is fitted with an array of comfort features including electrically adjustable front seats with memory function for driver's seat. Also, there is an auto air conditioning unit and an advanced parking assistance. To add to the customer excitement, the manufacturer is offering panoramic sliding sunroof as a standard feature for all the variants. The manufacturer is offering this vehicle with innovative active safety features such as impact protection beams, tyre pressure monitoring system along with ATTENTION ASSIST and three point seat belts. It also happens to be the first vehicle in its class to feature seven airbags as standard. Also available for the customers to choose are the optional packages, which includes various equipments and facilities. Those includes rear seat entertainment package, all season floor mats and a stowage carte. Currently positioned in the entry level luxury SUV segment, it is rivaling against the likes of Audi Q3 and BMW X1 in India. It is currently available on offer with an unbeatable warranty of 3-years without any restrictions to its kilometers.This SUV from Mercedes Benz has a typical body structure unlike an SUV, and it stands with a total height of just 1494mm. This adorns it a look that no other SUV has it in their respective segment. Its front facade does like classy, but the sporty cosmetics renders it an intimidating look. The radiator grille up front has horizontally positioned louvres and are embedded with the company's logo. The headlight cluster has a black tinted design and is housed with xenon headlamps along with signature LED DRLs and turn indicators. Below this, it has a dual tone bumper featuring a pair of large air ducts and an air dam, which offers better ventilation to the engine. When viewed from the side facade, this vehicle looks much alike a crossover owing to its low and masculine stance. The primary reason for its sophistication is because of the so called 'dropping-line' that extends from its headlamps to the rear fenders. The flared up wheel fenders are accompanied with a set of alloy wheels that further adds to its dynamic stance. There are several other stying features given to this vehicle including aluminum ski racks, body colored door handles and glossy window frames. As for the rear, this SUV has a perfect look with larger taillight cluster and rugged bumper. As we can see, its bumper has a dual tone scheme owing to the black colored protective cladding. The windscreen is also accompanied by a spoiler featuring an integrated LED third brake light along with a wiper as well. The overall look of this vehicle is emphasized by the prominent company's star, which is embedded on to the tailgate.Exterior Measurements:The manufacturer has built this four wheeler with an overall length measuring 4417mm along with a decent height of just 1494mm. Its minimum ground clearance is 183mm, which is somewhat equivalent to a conventional sedan. This vehicle has a decent width of 1804mm (excluding ORVMs) and a wheelbase of 2699mm, which is quite long.Ed's take:\u000a The GL-Class always had spacious interiors, however the styling was basic. Mercedes-Benz has taken care of this aspect in the new one and now the design is contemporary and we will like interiors of this SUV.\u000a  From the outside, it looks like a compact vehicle, but step inside, the cabin design will tell you a different tale with its huge space. With this SUV, customers will get an option to customized its interiors with three different color schemes. Furthermore, they can be highlighted by either metallic or wooden veneers.

The GL 63 AMG does a naught to 100km/hr in under 5 seconds.\u000a  Being mated with 7-speed DSG automatic transmission gearbox, both the power plants scores high with regards to acceleration and pickup. They can achieve a top speed in the range of 205 Kmph. As far as pickup is concerned, its oil-burners can break the 100 Kmph speed mark from a standstill in 9.9 seconds, while the petrol trims can do it in just 7.6 seconds.Ed's take: \u000a The GL-Class now has better power to weight ratio, despite the same engine and the drivability has always been good. The only thing that we dislike is the responsiveness of the transmission.\u000a  The petrol version is powered by a 2.0-litre, in-line drive-train that is integrated with variable valve control technology and direct fuel injection system. This power plant comprises of 4-cylinders and 16-valves altogether making a displacement capacity of 1991cc. This DOHC based mill is also integrated with a turbocharger that helps it to deliver a maximum power of 181bhp at 5500rpm in combination with 300Nm of pounding torque between just 1200 to 4000rpm. While its diesel variants draw power from a 2.2-litre oil-burner that has the latest generation common rail fuel injection system. This motor is also based on DOHC valve configuration featuring 4-cylinders along with 16-valves, which displaces 2143cc. This motor is integrated with high pressure Piezo injectors that enables it to produce a maximum power of 134bhp in the range of 3600 to 4400rpm and yields a superior torque output of 300Nm between 1600 to 3000rpm. The car maker has paired both these motors with an efficient 7-speed DSG automatic transmission gearbox that releases the torque output to its front wheels.Ed's take\u000a : Buyers of GL-Class do not worry about efficiency, still the GL-Class is generous with its fuel consumption. Especially, the GL 63 AMG owners which is the most powerful SUV in India at the moment.\u000a  Its oil-burner is integrated with a critically acclaimed CRDI fuel injection system featuring Piezo injectors. These are high pressure injectors, which enables the power plant to unleash immense power and at the same time, they also helps to deliver a maximum mileage of 17.7 Kmpl. While its petrol engine is incorporated with a conventional direct fuel injection system. This empowers the SUV to give away a maximum mileage in the range of 12 to 14 Kmpl.Ed's take\u000a : The power produced by the GL-Class is good on paper and we have liked this 3.0-litre V6 diesel mill. The GL 63 AMG is the most powerful SUV in India with about 550bhp of power available on tap.\u000a  Its 4-cylindered diesel drive-train is based on DOHC configuration and displaces 2143cc. This turbocharged motor has the ability to churn out a maximum power of 134.1bhp in combination with 300Nm of hammering torque. Its petrol motor is also based on a 4-cylinder configuration and is integrated with variable valve control technology for optimum power generation. It can belt out 181.03bhp of maximum power along with 300Nm of hammering torque.Ed's take:\u000a Mercedes-Benz has ensured that the GL-Class comes loaded with several accessories and a huge list is also available as an option.\u000a  Its entry level trim gets a cutting-edge central media system featuring 14.7cm touchscreen. It also comprises of a CD player, radio tuner along with connectivity ports for AUX-In and USB devices. Also, there is Bluetooth connectivity for seamless audio streaming and for in-cabin telephonic operation. Its high end trim on the other hand is also blessed with a 450W surround system system designed by Harman Kardon. It delivers superior quality sound output with the help of 9 loudspeakers and 9-channel DSP amplifier.Ed's take\u000a : The GL-Class drives just like a car. This is the biggest advantage that it possesses. The handling of the AMG is definitely much better than the conventional E-Class.\u000a  This SUV is bestowed with 'comfort' suspension system comprising multilink system for its rear axle and an independent strut suspension for the front one. In terms of braking, its front wheels are fitted with a sturdy set of ventilated disc brakes, whereas its rear ones are coupled to solid disc brakes. Aiding this mechanism is the anti lock braking system that works in combination with brake assist function to reduce the possibility of skidding. In addition to these, this SUV gets a latest generation electronic stability program that works in collaboration with curve dynamic and hill hold assist.Ed's take:\u000a The safety features list is long on the GL-Class as it gets airbags, ABS, ESP, hill-assist, PRE-SAFE etc.\u000a  This SUV is built with high strength aluminum material, which is quite rigid and capable of dealing with collisions. It comprises of side impact protection beams and crumple zones at critical areas for added safety. As for the features front. both the trims in this series are equipped with identical safety functions. Some of those include seven airbags, three point ELR seat belts, head restraints, driver's seat belt warning, door open indicator, rear parking sensors, seat occupancy recognition system for front passenger, collapsible steering wheel and anti-glare inside rear view mirrors. Besides these, they also have an advanced engine immobilizer system with rolling code, remote central locking system including unlocking of doors, anti-theft alarm, and protective under-body guard. The manufacturer has also incorporated it with sophisticated programs like electronic stability control, dynamic curve assist, hill hold assist, anti lock braking system, anti slip regulation, and brake assist function.Both the trims level in this model series have been bestowed with a set of 18-inch, 5-twin spoke design alloy wheels. The only difference is that the 'Style' trim gets these rims with high-sheen black finish, whereas in top end variant, they have vandanium silver finish. These rims are wrapped with 235/50 R18 sized tubeless radial tyres for better grip on any road condition.1. Its internal cabin has better space than expected. 2. Compact size helps it to glide through traffic easily. 3. Comfort aspects are far better than other competitors. 4. Engine performance along with acceleration is quite good. 5. This is the first vehicle in its segment to have seven airbags.1. More options can be given to customize its interior design and color scheme. 2. Fuel economy of petrol motor is rather poor. 3. Price range can be more competitive. 4. Head room is not as good as other SUVs. 5. There is still scope to improve its minimum ground clearance.
