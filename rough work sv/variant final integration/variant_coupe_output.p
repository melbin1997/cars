Altogether, it can soar to a top speed of 250kmph, which is a formidable figure indeed for its class and size. The company has imbued the exterior vision of the car with many plush elements and trendy items. The multi spoke alloy wheels, the polished body curvatures and the chrome highlights together make it a visual spectacle.

VBMW M Series M6 Gran Coupe review\u000a  BMW M series M6 Gran Coupe is one among the variants in the exclusive M series portfolio. This newly revised version comes with some minor updates, primarily to its exteriors. The vehicle gets a mildly modified front grille that gives it a renewed look. The slick headlamps for this version are blessed with adaptive LED lights. Few vehicles have been known to offer utility and comfort as exhaustively as this one does. The sports styled seats come with lumbar support, memory function, an adjustable thigh support, articulated upper backrest and many other comfort elements that completely dissolve strain for the occupant when driving. Further sparing hassle for the driver is an electric park bake with an automatic hold function. An integrated 3 button universal garage door opener is also present for reduced burdens when operating. Like all models of this company, the car's outfit carries a rich luster that adds to its image. Its streamlined shape and well balanced proportions make it ideal for speed on the road as well. It is powered by the same V8 twin-turbo engine that features an electronically controlled engine cooling system. The engine is also harnessed with a brake energy re-generation system, which helps to cut fuel and promote efficiency.\u000a...READ MORE

VBMW M Series X6 M review\u000a  BMW M Series X6 M is a variant in this M model series. Like all other company's vehicles, this car has an abundance of delights both inside and outside. It has been packed with a 4.4-litre V8 engine, which allows it to cross the 100kmph in just 4.2 seconds. Its formidable performance is insulated by strong safety programs, such as the cornering brake control, dynamic stability control and the brake assist feature. Three point seatbelts keep the occupants secure, and it comes along with belt tensioners, pyrotechnic belt tensioners and belt force limiters. A parking distance control is present at the front and rear, and it prohibits mishaps when reversing. Coming to the interior facet, the refined atmosphere goes along with a massive range of comfort features. There is a Touchscreen audio and navigation system, together with an ambient lighting facility, 4 zone automatic air conditioning, an electric steering column and a start/stop button for the highest comfort. The exteriors are given a strong allure with the benefit of various colour schemes, dynamic alloy wheels, sweeping lines and artistic curvatures. Its hefty proportions impart a bold and aggressive look, which is overlapped by a more affluent design template.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt has a majestic bearing with its large shape and its elegant themes. At the front, the M double kidney grille comes in a black finish, giving a stunning look to the front. In addition to this, the sleek shape of the headlamps on either side also adds to the visual spectacle of the front. The company has incorporated the lamps with adaptive LED systems, together with four LED DRL rings. Positioned below this, the small LED fog lamps help to bring better visibility when driving. The enlarged air intake section also brings improvement to the look, while at the same time, diffuses heat within the engine. By the side, the vehicle has been graced with M light alloy wheels that come with a double spoke design. The delicate fenders also add appeal to the side.

VGT V8 S Convertible\u000a  Bentley owes its global domination in the luxury car segment to models like the Continental GT. This model was released in 2003 and, over the decade or so, has emerged as popular name in the car market. The model is available in a list of variants, one among which is the Bentley Continental GT V8 S Convertible. A highlight of this variant is its convertible format, which further adds to its already exalting appeal. The car is powered by a massive V8 engine, which delivers strong performance, but also ensures that the fuel economy is not compromised. Coming to the looks of the machine, it has a wide and powerful stance. A slender and aerodynamic shape further enhances its looks. The vehicle owes its bold demeanour to its muscular hood, distinctive body lines and noticeable wheel fenders. Coming to the inside of the car, the cabin offers a rich and energetic aura to go with the drive. Fine seat upholstery, attractive accents and a range of other design elements improve the interior environment to its best. Beside this, the passengers are kept engaged with some good comfort and convenience functions, along with a superior grade entertainment system.\u000a...READ MORE

VJaguar F-Type Coupe review\u000a  JLR, one of the iconic luxury car makers has launched the coupe version of its sports car model, Jaguar F Type. The company has introduced three new variants in this model series among which, the Jaguar F Type Coupe is the entry level trim. This particular variant is powered by a 3.0-litre, V6 petrol power plant that comes with a displacement capacity of 2999cc. This new variant has the ability to break the 100 Kmph speed barrier in just 5.3 seconds and it can reach up to 260 Kmph of maximum speed, which is remarkable. The company has built this particular trim on the same platform on which the F-type convertible was built. The car maker claims that its chassis is now 30 percent stiffer, which helps in adding to the safety quotient. The company is offering this trim with a number of advanced aspects, which include dynamic stability control, sport-shift selector with jet leather, sports suspension are just to name a few. This entry level coupe version roughly comes with all the features that are standard in the base convertible version. This variant also features an advanced 8-inch color touchscreen that supports navigation system and an advanced stereo unit as well.\u000a...READ MORE

VLand Rover Range Rover Evoque Pure review\u000a  Land Rover Range Rover Evoque Pure is the base trim of this scintillating Evoque series. This SUV is available only with a diesel engine and at the same time this particular trim is offered with an automatic transmission gear box mated with all wheel drive. Externally, its looks are sharp with edgy bumpers and other fascinating cosmetics all over. Insides are decorated with fine leather and chrome accents all around the compartment. Cabin is spacious with well cushioned seats and accommodates five people with ease. It has a lot of other features like armrests, cup holders, storage spaces and still has generous leg room and shoulder space. Features such as a Meridian infotainment system and Bluetooth connectivity also add to the convenience aspect of the driver. Technically, a fuel economy between 17.39 to 23.08 Kmpl can be expected of this utility vehicle, under standard driving conditions. The car maker is offering a superior warranty, which makes the buyer go on a hassle free drive at all times.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPossessing a solitary design with freehanded dimensions, this SUV walks down the carpet in a show stopping costume. Its roof spoiler serves as an extension to its body in making it look longer. The neatly carved out wheel arches are affixed with a set of 17 inch alloy rims that are framed with a sparkle finish. These are further covered with robust tubeless radials and there is also a full sized spare wheel in its boot compartment. Both the roof and spoiler stand in unity with a uniform body color.

VAston Martin Vantage V8 Sport review\u000a  There is no other supercar in the market that blends power, beauty and soul when you press the ignition, the way the Aston Martin V8 Vantage does. Aston Martin cars are known for their superior performance and outstanding quality. These cars are amazingly fast but also very comfortable to drive. They have all the abilities of a Grand Tourer. The looks of the Aston Martin Vantage are jaw dropping and the car has finesse spilled all over it. The Aston Martin V8 vantage is very similar to the Aston Martin DB9 in terms of features. The car has a low stance which makes it look like a sports car but on the inside it also makes you feel like you are in a sedan considering the tremendous comfort offered. The company offers this car in both Coupe and Roadster versions with an \u201cS\u201d variant to both the versions. The car uses a horizontal splitter under the lower front grille in order to increase airflow under the car. A new lower front air dam and bumper setup built from carbon fibre creates a more aggressive look than before for the front end of the Aston Martin. This also functions to provide more air for the cooling of the new design front brakes. At the rear end of the car is a more prominent deck lid which the company claims reduces lift at high speeds. The carbon fibre diffuser also helps airflow from underneath the car. The sporty feel is further enhanced when the driver pushes the sport button on the dash allowing the exhaust bypass valves to open fully and let out a strong Aston Martin V8 rumble. The inside of the Aston Martin V8 Vantage is one of the most exquisite handcrafted cabins in the industry with impeccable levels of fit and finish. Once you get into the cabin of the Aston Martin V8 Vantage through its upswing doors, you are greeted by the embroidered VANTAGE logos on the carpets and headrests. Aston Martin wanted this car to be more driver-focused with a more involving character overall which is why, to increase performance, they have tuned the suspension and stability control. Aston Martin builds each of its V8 engines at their facility in Cologne, Germany. The Aston Martin V8 Vantage secured its position as the automakers sportiest model when it was introduced at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show for the 2006 model year and ever since then, it has lived up to every expectation a person would want both from inside and outside. The Aston Martin V8 Vantage holds the trump card when it comes to handling. It has better driving dynamics than its rivals and it also has the iconic design of the Aston Martin. While the aluminium platforms are virtually identical to the standard Aston Martin V8 Vantage coupe and roadster models, the British automaker is targeting driving enthusiasts with these heavily upgraded Aston Martin V8 Vantage S variants. \u000a...READ MORE

VAston Martin Vantage V8 4.7L review\u000a  The Aston Martin Vantage is a supreme example of modern automotive design and hand crafted sports car that offers exceptional performance along with outstanding agility. This is one of the world's most beautiful cars with controlled aggression along with a enigmatic stance, which is incorporated with classic design cues. In India, it is being sold in quite a few variants, of which, Aston Martin Vantage V8 4.7L is the mid range trim. It comes with exquisite craftsmanship and elegant design that is capable enough to make heads turn anywhere. It is blessed with a powerful 4.7-litre petrol engine, which comes with a displacement capacity of 4735cc. This quad overhead camshaft based motor can unleash a maximum power of 420bhp in combination with a commanding torque output of 470Nm, which is rather incredible. This car has been engineered for poise, balance and grace, expressed aesthetically by the flowing muscular bodywork. The long low bonnet line and two seater internal cabin provides the perfect balance between beauty and sporting intent. Its side profile forms a simple sweep curved line, while the rear looks quite wide and muscular. The company has reduced the size and weight of coupe to maximize the agility. It comes with an overall length of just 4380mm, which is one of the smallest models from their stable. At the same time, technology is at the heart of this luxurious vehicle. It is blessed with an Emotion Control Unit that connects the occupants to the heart of the car. This sophisticated stainless steel and glass device is inserted into the center of the dash and then pressed to fire the glorious sound. On the whole, this coupe is designed for incredible performance and creates complete synthesis between driver and machine.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VPorsche 911 Turbo review\u000a  Porsche 911 Turbo is designed for outstanding performance, as well as a vibrant body design for a more holistic feel. The 3800cc engine propels the vehicle to a top speed of 315kmph, which is extraordinary even among sports cars. This, together with an acceleration rate of 3.4 seconds places this among the most formidable vehicles of the day. The interior and exterior styling also exceeds the mark, with plush leather treatment for the interiors and many other attractive highlights. Entertainment is granted with a BOSE Surround Sound System, which is amplified with the presence of 12 speakers. On the outside, the refined body design is further underscored by the alloy wheels, the low profile and the rear spoiler. A prized element of this vehicle is its convertible format, and with the roof withdrawn, it strikes an even more awe evoking posture.\u000a...READ MORE

VBentley Continental GT review\u000a  Bentley has been in the global car market for a long time. The amazing R-Type Continental came up in 1950's and the Continental GT showed up later in the 21st century. The Bentley Continental GT is a perfect amalgamation of modern design and advanced technology. This car is a revolution in its own. The car is an ideal example of Bentley\u2019s skilled engineers that make the car an ultimate tourer. The low-sprung and wide appearance make the coupe appear to be much more attractive and a true mean machine. The superior suspension along with intelligent continuous damping control makes the ride and handling of the car very smooth and impressive. The Bentley Continental GT is an all-wheel drive and features a powerful and dynamic 12-cylinder engine that generates ample amounts of power and a respectable amount of torque, making it a perfect drive in any weather or road condition. The engine has been coupled with an 8-speed QuickShift transmission. The car also features an advanced system, that immediately adjusts the power split between the rear and front wheels depending upon the available grip. Furthermore, it also sports electronic stability control that operates along with the AWD system that assures better driving style for the owner.\u000a...READ MORE

VFerrari FF GT review\u000a  The Ferrari FF is a popular car model from the acclaimed Italian super-car maker. This vehicle is unique as one of the fastest four wheel drive models ever made. It is currently available in one trim level, which is the Ferrari FF GT . This variant is armed with a 12 cylinder engine that promotes stunning performance. It enables the vehicle to race from 0 to 100kmph within just 3.7 seconds. Coming to a softer facet, the body of the vehicle is streamlined and graceful, promoting a good airflow for better performance. The company has designed it on third millennium aerodynamic and conceptual solutions to accentuate its sporty stance. It has a 'shooting brake' shape and modern stylish cues that give it an enhanced appeal. Coming to the interiors, the cabin is detailed with plush elements to render it a pleasant appeal. The seats are dressed in fine upholstery that further enhances the environment. There is a musical system along with many other comfort systems that enhance passenger satisfaction for a fulfilling drive. All of this and more makes this one of this company's definitive models.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt has an aerodynamic profile that is crafted with the aim of improved performance capacities. Its sporty form comes along with luxury themes for a more broad ranging appeal. A striking grille at the bottom of the front section makes a commanding design statement. The prominent emblem of the company is posted at the center of the grille. On either side, there are sleekly shaped headlamp clusters, which the company has integrated all the necessary lighting systems with. The hood has a wide and toned build, with clean lines over it for a more exquisite touch. Coming to the side, the wheel fenders are delicately designed, and beneath them, there are attractive wheel rims. These are available with the option of high polish aluminum, high gloss black or Matt black finish for a more personalized touch. Within the wheel rims, the brake calipers are visible and offered with a range of personalization options as well. The body hosts well sculpted lines that add to its powerful presence. The door handles are neatly designed and blend into the overall look seamlessly. The rear section of the machine is strong and burly, adding to the vehicle's masculine dynamics. There are muscled lines and well shaped curves that further shape its energetic figure. There are circular tail lamps that come with turn indicators and courtesy lights for good safety standards. The bumper houses two exhaust pipes on either side, which further enrich the vehicle's sporty appeal.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe cabin space has been intelligently modeled, ensuring optimal comfort for all of the passengers. The seats are built on strong ergonomic design, enabling a sound ride environment through the drive. The cabin trim comes with the choice of Alcantara or semi aniline leather, and a two toned option. The 'body hugging' format of the seats works to keep the occupants in an optimal level of comfort. Headrests are present on all of the seats, offering support to the passengers. There are armrests on both rows, allowing convenient placement of arms. At the front, the driver gets the benefit of a sporty designed steering wheel, which has multi-functional buttons for ease of operating. The dashboard is also cleverly built, and several of its features are available in carbon fiber. Additionally, the dashboard comes with the choice of two new fabrics like Alutex with aluminum effect or Titantex with titanium effect.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe vehicle is powered by a V12 engine that facilitates strong performance. This power plant is armed with a high pressure GDI system, along with a split injection control that enables flawless fuel transfer. The engine has a displacement capacity of 6262cc. It generates a power of 652hp at 800rpm, along with a torque of 683Nm at 6000rpm. The engine is paired with a seven speed dual clutch transmission that enables flawless gear shifting. Altogether, the car can touch top speeds of nearly 335kmph, which is a remarkable figure.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe vehicle's build ensures good standards for all of its facets, including the braking and handling systems. Starting with the brakes, the carbon ceramic braking system ensures a good control for the vehicle throughout. There are 398mm discs at the front, and 360mm discs at the rear. Beside this, the anti lock braking system is present, giving added control when braking. Going along with this is the electronic brake-force distribution function, as well as an electronic stability control system. An E-Differential system is also present for optimal ride control. The car is also gifted with Ferrari's unique F1-Traction system, which works to bring an excellent level of safety throughout. Meanwhile, the Magnetorheological suspension system ensures ride stability and comfort as well. This arrangement features double wishbones at the front, and a redesigned multi-link system at the rear for reduced road anomalies and a smooth drive.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFirstly, there is an advanced Infotainment system that takes care of the entertainment needs of the passengers. This comes along with a 6.5 inch high high-contrast display, along with a touch screen control for optimum convenience. Bluetooth connectivity is also present that allows audio streaming and call operation. The system also has a satellite navigation feature to provide assistance to the driver. This feature is further enhanced by a 3D view facility. The sophistication of the cabin is improved with a voice command feature, which allows for control free operations.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe car's body format is based on high level of impact resistance technology, working to minimize damage in case of a collision. There are seatbelts for keeping the passengers secure, and a pre-tensioner facility tightens seatbelts in case of collisions. Front impact airbags are present for shielding the front occupants from mishaps, and side airbags are also present for optimal safety. Lastly, a security system is also present, affirming the security of the vehicle and preventing theft.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Extraordinary performance and acceleration.\u000a\u000a2. Stunning body design and looks.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Many more comfort features can be given as standard.\u000a\u000a2.

VMercedes-Benz S-Class S 63 AMG Coupe review\u000a  Mercedes Benz India is a fully owned subsidiary of the German car maker, which has established itself all over the world. Its vehicles are lavishly designed and fitted with power packed engines. The S-Class is probably the most luxurious vehicle. Now the company has launched its AMG variant in the Indian car market, which is christened as Mercedes-Benz S-Class S 63 AMG Coupe . This variant is fitted with a breathtaking and irresistible engine, which is a paragon of poise and assurance. Its 5.5-litre V8 Biturbo petrol mill has the capacity of churning out a whopping power of 585bhp in combination with a mammoth torque output of 900Nm. This variant has an exclusive body kit in the form of sporty bumpers, radiator grille, V8 BITURBO lettering on front wing, sturdy set of alloy wheels and AMG sports exhaust system, which emphasizes its exclusivity. On the other hand, its internal cabin is bestowed with newly developed AMG sports seats with electrical adjustment, memory and heating function for front seats, Nappa leather upholstery with piping and AMG badges and AMG emblem on the armrest of the front center console that create an exquisite atmosphere on board. Another feature displaying the hallmark AMG look is the high-resolution TFT color display with two animated round dials. This vehicle will compete against the likes of Audi A8L, BMW 7 series and Jaguar XJ in the luxury segment. It is being offered with an attractive warranty program of 3-years without any limitation to its mileage. Furthermore, with the help of 'Star Care Plus' program, the warranty can be extended to another year, which will help to enhance the resale value.\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VPorsche 911 Turbo S Cabriolet review\u000a  Porsche has been the pioneer behind the some of the world's most spectacular vehicles and 911 is one among them. This is a model that has basked in critical fame for decades of its existence. Among the list of variants available for the current version, one is the Porsche 911 Turbo S Cabriolet . Armed with a turbocharged engine, it touches a top speed of 318kmph, and rips from naught to 100kmph in a mere 3.2 seconds. The engine's prowess goes along with a well enforced braking and suspension. Further, there are numerous stability systems and aids to guard its control and handling. Coming to a softer side, the vehicle makes an unforgettable mark with its bold body format. Its low and streamlined profile is tailored for the needs of speed and agility. The company has enriched its exterior allure with plush themes such as chrome highlights, alloy wheels, body coloured door handles and glossy metallic skin. The inside of the car is conditioned with a blend of style and comfort. Fine upholstery covers the seats, and a variety of fine materials decorate the cabin area. Full electric adjustment facility is present for the seating, giving ease of working for the occupants. Safety is also affirmed with the presence of strong seatbelts, airbags for the front occupants, headrests and many other features that are instrumental in keeping the passengers secure and safe. All of this and more places this among the ideal vehicles for the Indian car market.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe 911 has been a symbol in history for its thrilling body form. It has a modern outfit, at the same time, stays anchored to its rugged racing origins. It has an aerodynamic precision in its structure, allowing the best speed capacity and also the most exalting look. Starting with the front, the bonnet has a low poise, allowing lesser air resistance when driving. Posted at the centre of the frontage is the company's marque, making a bold statement. On either side, there are circular lights that come incorporated with bi-Xenon lights and daytime running lights for sharper visibility when driving. The wide air intake section at the bottom also looks good, at the same time keeping the engine and brakes cool. The side profile of the car is emphasised by the streamlined shape and the subtle body lines. The wheel archs are appropriately designed and beneath them, the cool wheel rims add flavour to the image. The door handles and outside mirrors are body coloured, making for a more harmonious picture. The car's slender persona is balanced with a more toned rear profile. The rear spoiler adds to the visually exotic picture, and there are air inlets above it for cooling the inside. The rear lights are sleek in design, and the company has graced them with courtesy lights and turn indicators for safety value. A feature to be noted in this car is its convertible format, which makes for an even more awe invoking image.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe cabin has been delicately treated, ensuring that limited space is utilised in optimal means. Sound ergonomic discipline has been employed to enhance the drive atmosphere for the occupants. The seats, door sides, front panel, steering wheel and the console have all been neatly designed for a harmonious image of elegance. The fully electric sports style seats are wide and comfortable, ensuring that thrills of speed go along with stress free comfort. Premium leather wraps the seats, giving an enriched drive feel for the occupants. A central armrest is present for both rows, promoting convenience for the length of the drive. Headrests are present for the front row occupants, blending comfort with safety. The driver gets the benefit of a sporty multifunction steering wheel. The ascending centre console is cool looking, and it impresses the distinctive feel of the cabin. There is a 4.6 inch screen above the instrument panel, which boosts the sophisticated image of the cabin. In addition to all of this, the interior space is embellished with wooden inlays, leather inserts and accents of aluminium and carbon. The brand is also offering an exhaustive range of personalisation options, allowing the customer to refine the look of the cabin according to his needs.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPacked under the hood is a 3.8-litre boxer engine that the company claims to have made from a superior lightweight metal design. This is a 6-cylindered engine with displacement capacity of 3800cc. Its performance is bolstered with two exhaust turbochargers that come along with variable turbine geometry. It is given the direct fuel injection system for efficient fuel transfer, and this function is further supported by a dry sump lubrication system. Going into technical specifications, the drive-train generates a power of 560bhp at 6500rpm to 6750rpm, together with a grinding torque of 700Nm at 2100rpm to 4250rpm. An efficient 7 speed gearbox transmits the power of the engine, allowing smooth shifting.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe car's integrity is preserved with quality for all facets of build, and this includes the braking and suspension systems. Six piston piston aluminium monobloc fixed calipers are rigged onto the front brakes, while four piston calipers secure the rear. In addition to this, cross drilled PCCB(Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake) brake discs further augment the car's braking performance. The Porsche Active Suspension Management system regulates the damping force on each wheel, thereby adding to the stability of the vehicle. The car is also gifted with a Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control, which improves the control quality when cornering and manoeuvring.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe adaptive sports seats come with electric adjustment, along with side bolsters, lumbar support and a memory package. The split folding rear seats also add utility to the cabin. A 12V power socket enables occupants to charge devices within the cabin. Also present are facilities such as cruise control, seat heating, illuminated vanity mirrors and cloth hooks. Available as standard is a BOSE surround sound system, which comes along with eight amplifier channels and 12 loudspeakers for the most engrossing audio experience. The Porsche communication management system acts as an interface for the audio, navigation and communication facilities within the car, giving optimal ease of usage for the occupants. The highlight of this feature is its intuitive colour touchscreen, which relieves hassle for the occupants. Also present with this system is a DCD audio drive that offers MP3 compatibility. An Aux-In facility, together with a USB port, allow passengers to integrate external devices with the system. Beside all of this, additional options include a mobile preparation system, a voice control system, a digital radio and a TV tuner.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe car wears a rigid bodyshell that reduces damage in case of a mishap. In addition to this, the anti lock braking system adds to the control quality when braking and cornering. Airbags provide critical shielding to the front passengers, and they come with a two stage inflation system for better use. Impact protection elements are incorporated in the doors for added protection in case of a sudden halt or a crash. In addition to this, there is a roll over protection system, which monitors the drive stability and deploys roll over bars in case the car loses balance.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Stunning exterior design and look.\u000a\u000a2. Excellent performance qualities.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. For its performance, it requires added safety measures.\u000a\u000a2. Its price range could deter buyers.\u000a...READ MORE

VRolls Royce Phantom Coupe review\u000a  Rolls-Royce is among the most illustrious car makers in the world, and the company's current line up of models includes the Phantom. Among the variants offered for this car, there is the Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupe , which comes with a decent list of features. Firstly, the vehicle is powered by a V12 engine that gives it strong performance qualities. It can race from 0 to 100kmph within just 5.8 seconds which is good considering its size. Furthermore, it touches top speeds of about 250kmph. Coming to the car's outfit, it has plush design themes that make it stand apart. The glossy metallic finish, the wide front radiator shell, the large wheels and the body lines together endow it a graceful overall look. It has a length of 5612mm, together with a width of 1987mm and a height of 1598mm. The cabin space is enriched with an assortment of premium materials. The plush seat upholstery, along with the various fine inlays, veneers and other exquisite elements render a luxurious interior atmosphere for the passengers. There are a host of comfort and entertainment facilities as well, starting from an advanced music system to numerous driver aids.\u000a...READ MORE

VJaguar F Type R Coupe review\u000a  Jaguar Land Rover has officially launched the coupe version of its premium sports car, Jaguar F Type in India. This sophisticated vehicle has made its debut in the country in three trim levels among which, Jaguar F Type R Coupe is the top end variant. This sports car is basically a hard top version of its already existing F Type convertible. However, this top end version comes with a highly powerful 5.0-litre, V8 super-charged petrol power plant that can achieve a top speed of 300 Kmph, while breaking the 100 Kmph mark in just a matter of 4.2 seconds. This high end sports car comes with several advanced aspects including the \u201cR\u201d performance seats in premium leather, Jaguar super performance braking system and torque vectoring system. Apart from these, the company is also offering this trim with advanced driving dynamics including sportshift selector with jet leather, intelligent start/stop function and much more.

The manufacturer is offering this advanced sports car with a set of 20-inch turbine silver alloy wheels that gives it a sophisticated look.\u000a...READ MORE

This variant has an aerodynamic body structure with several features that makes it look tempting. Whereas, there are options to customize the interior trims and upholstery as per the choice of buyers. The best part is its diamond pattern seating, which has contrast stitching and piping that emphasizes its exclusiveness. One of the most innovative aspects is its assistance system that features a stereo camera. It captures the objects and pedestrians passing in front of the vehicle and analyses the data using intelligent algorithms. This ultimately makes the driving safer and more relaxing, especially on city roads. It is competing against the likes of Audi A8L, BMW 7 Series and Jaguar XJ in the luxury saloon segment. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis variant has a distinct body design and equipped with urbane cosmetics, which gives it a magnificent look on the road.

VPorsche Cayman GTS review\u000a  The automotive industry has been raised to the heights of glory that we know it for today only with the pioneering and excellence of its top brand leaders. And emblazoned among the greatest car makers in history, is the world renowned Porsche. Here is a company that delivers excellence on every level, making vehicles of high performance and all the best features all in one. And among its very greatest models is the Cayman . Originally launched in 2005, this is a model that mixes elegance and power in one, bringing forth the greatest masterpieces of all time. The latest version of this car is being launched in two variants, the S and the GTS . The GTS files as the top end variant, built for more refined performance. It is locked in with a hefty 3.4-litre flat-six engine, integrated with direct fuel injection (DFI) and VarioCam Plus. It fries the road with a displacement value of 3436cc. The engine sends the car roaring with a raw power of 340bhp. This, in combination with a peak torque of 380Nm makes this one of the mightiest road machines ever raised. The car storms from not to 100kmph in a stunning 4.9 seconds. It can reach an enthralling top speed of 285kmph. Coming to its softer and more elegant side, this is a model that is built as a host of the greatest elegance and comfort as well. Its exterior profile is striking, low and streamlined for the most agile look it can deliver. Its inner grandeur is complete with an expensive array of equipment and the finest materials adorning it. All put together, this is a machine that strives to bring a human touch to its passengers, and it is destined to succeed.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPorsche stands among the most classy brands there is, and they capture the finest beauty in automobile architecture with this model. It promises to not only roast the streets, but also to stun them. It has prominent wings at the front, stylized by Porsche's signature design. A bold set of headlights adorn both sides, incorporated with LED daytime running lights and position lights. Large, dynamic air intakes sit right below this, ensuring a maximum cooling area for the mighty engine sitting underneath the hood, and also giving an imposing look to the front portion. A sleek silhouette and a long wheelbase give it a touch of harmony in its overall build. Large wheels surrounded by prominent fenders, along with narrow side windows bring forth a grand flavor to the side profile of the vehicle. A rear spoiler exists, hidden at normal speeds and deploying when the vehicle reaches 120kmph. The vehicle's rear profile is large and hefty, building a feel of menace from behind. Its rear lamps are slender and well designed, complete with LED, brake lights and courtesy lights for safety to go along with well tasted looks. A framed stainless steel tailpipe seals the wealthy, eye-catching build that this vehicle stands for.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe interiors of this car are conditioned for a sense of modern luxury to go along with high speed thrills. It is decorated with fine adornments and the best of materials, ensuring that the passengers are allowed to soak in a ride atmosphere that stays with them even after stepping out of the car. A well designed, ascending center console places an imposing feature at the front of the cabin. Its standard sports seats and low positioned, meant for a cool luxury and also for added room inside the car. Fitted as standard, their prominent seat side bolsters and sporty firm padding provide even better lateral support. The headrests are embroidered with \u2018GTS\u2019 logos. Black leather upholstery coats the cabin. In addition to this, Alcantara lines the lower section of the dashboard, the doors, the lid of the centre console storage compartment, the steering wheel and the gear lever/selector. Even the roof lining and A-pillars are lined with Alcantara. The \u2018Cayman GTS\u2019 logo adorns the door sill guards for the most exquisite touch to the sporty interior condition. Sporty and ergonomic gearshifts enable better, faster and more convenient shifting for the driver, and add a touch of beauty to the overall emphasis of the inner space. Located on the left is the ignition lock. The three spoke sports steering wheel is meant to top off the overall excellence of the sports design, falling in line perfectly with the driver's needs. And behind the steering wheel are three central, round instruments, providing information about the speed and other details of the ride. Located behind is a generously large luggage compartment, finished in brushed aluminum. In addition to all this, storage compartments on both sides handle all convenience needs of the passengers.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt has a powerful 3.4-litre engine, meant to build a gritty performance on city roads. The drivetrain has a displacement value of 3436cc. The power that the engine delivers is channeled and unleashed to its full capacity through an efficient 6-speed manual transmission. The machine fires to maximum power of 340hp, and a peak torque of 380Nm, possibly some of the best figures in terms of engine performance. These figures translate to a peak speed of 285kmph, and the capacity to go from not to 100kmph in just 4.9 seconds. This is quite possibly among the most edgy sports models ever build.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Porsche Cayman GTS has amazing performance, but the machine balances its deadly speed capacity with efficient braking and control systems. Four piston aluminum monobloc fixed calipers arm its front and rear brakes, with discs that are internally vented and cross-drilled. In addition to this, it has a high grade suspension system, with lightweight spring-strut suspension at the front and the rear axle, enabling the best stability always. The vehicle ventures past technological barriers as well to bring the best aids in control and handling. It has a unique feature known as the Porsche torque vectoring plus. This increases stability when driving by spreading the torque to the rear wheels and, therefore, locking in a far better control over the vehicle. In addition to this, another high tech feature known as the Porsche active suspension management function exists, aiming to bring a better drive stability with the aid of an upgraded suspension system.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe inner comfort that a vehicle offers is one its primary features, and Porsche has always scored high on this regard. The Porsche Cayman GTS delivers an inner atmosphere complete on the highest order of comfort and convenience. It has expensive, leather upholstery and Alcantara lining for the most premium environment. In addition to the luxury of its build, it aims to bring a top grade audio experience. This is accomplished with a sophisticated CDR audio system. Going alongside these is a Bose surround system that takes the speakers to their fullest capacity. Further raising the inner comfort is a unique feature known as the Porsche communication management system. A reversing camera aids the driver when in need of parking and other necessities. All brought together, the luxury that this machine is built with refines the drive experience for the most unforgettable and also the most homely feel for its passengers.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe massive speed capacity of this machine is not let loose without a firm guard on safety. The Porsche Cayman GTS incorporates the best elements to ensure safety for its passengers. It has a speed limit display that gives a heads-up to its driver when crossing speed barriers. In addition to this, it has techno features to ensure safety, such as the Porsche torque vectoring plus and the Porsche active suspension management function. It is complete on all standard features of safety as well. Tight seatbelts seal the passengers with their best security all through. Well cushioned airbags provide the best guard when times of emergency do arrive. The body of this rogue machine is hardened and rigid, meant to provide insulation to collisions and the best protection from impacts.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Excellent performance capacity.\u000a\u000a2. Attractive looks.\u000a\u000a3. Comfortable interiors with a range of comfort features and accessories.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Its mighty performance leaves its mileage suffering.\u000a\u000a2. Great speed capacity is not aided with an easy control ability.\u000a\u000a3.

The rear lights are sleek, integrated with LED, turn lights and courtesy lights. A stylistically written 'Lamborghini' sits at the bottom of the rear profile. A wide exhaust pipe, located at the center of the rear, wraps up the car's looks at its finest.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe extraordinary performance of the car does not lead to a setback for the interior design.

A dry sump lubrication system further cleans the interiors of the car, ensuring that the engine's lubrication needs are always taken care of.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Lamborghini Aventador Roadster LP 700 4 makes for performance like few other vehicles ever made. This goes well in hand with the help of an efficient braking and control system. Its front brakes are armed with a set of 6-cylinder brake calipers, while 4-cylinder brake calipers take care of the rear ones. The vehicle also has a dual hydraulic circuit brake system with a vacuum brake booster that further raises control and braking for the driver's needs. A front and rear mono tube damper with push rod system aids the suspension system. Taking its ways past conventional barriers, the vehicle is equipped with the anti-brake locking system that guides its handling and keeps it smooth always.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is a machine built to set the road ablaze.

A digital tyre pressure gauge allows the driver to keep tabs with the needs of its tyre throughout. An anti-theft system locks in security for the vehicle as well, bringing the safety of the vehicle to the fore as well.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. It has amazing performance, possibly among the best machines ever built.\u000a\u000a2. The most attractive body build, and a well enhanced profile.\u000a\u000a3. Astonishing speed that goes along with the best control as well.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Its mileage suffers as a result of its high performance.\u000a\u000a2.

VPorsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet review\u000a  Porsche has been the pioneer behind the some of the world's most spectacular vehicles and 911 is one among them. This is a model that has basked in critical fame for decades of its existence. Among the list of variants available for the current version, one is the Porsche 911 Turbo S Cabriolet . Armed with a turbocharged engine, it touches a top speed of 318kmph, and rips from naught to 100kmph in a mere 3.2 seconds. The engine's prowess goes along with a well enforced braking and suspension. Further, there are numerous stability systems and aids to guard its control and handling. Coming to a softer side, the vehicle makes an unforgettable mark with its bold body format. Its low and streamlined profile is tailored for the needs of speed and agility. The company has enriched its exterior allure with plush themes such as chrome highlights, alloy wheels, body coloured door handles and glossy metallic skin. The inside of the car is conditioned with a blend of style and comfort. Fine upholstery covers the seats, and a variety of fine materials decorate the cabin area. Full electric adjustment facility is present for the seating, giving ease of working for the occupants. Safety is also affirmed with the presence of strong seatbelts, airbags for the front occupants, headrests and many other features that are instrumental in keeping the passengers secure and safe. All of this and more places this among the ideal vehicles for the Indian car market.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe 911 has been a symbol in history for its thrilling body form. It has a modern outfit, at the same time, stays anchored to its rugged racing origins. It has an aerodynamic precision in its structure, allowing the best speed capacity and also the most exalting look. Starting with the front, the bonnet has a low poise, allowing lesser air resistance when driving. Posted at the centre of the frontage is the company's marque, making a bold statement. On either side, there are circular lights that come incorporated with bi-Xenon lights and daytime running lights for sharper visibility when driving. The wide air intake section at the bottom also looks good, at the same time keeping the engine and brakes cool. The side profile of the car is emphasised by the streamlined shape and the subtle body lines. The wheel archs are appropriately designed and beneath them, the cool wheel rims add flavour to the image. The door handles and outside mirrors are body coloured, making for a more harmonious picture. The car's slender persona is balanced with a more toned rear profile. The rear spoiler adds to the visually exotic picture, and there are air inlets above it for cooling the inside. The rear lights are sleek in design, and the company has graced them with courtesy lights and turn indicators for safety value. A feature to be noted in this car is its convertible format, which makes for an even more awe invoking image.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe cabin has been delicately treated, ensuring that limited space is utilised in optimal means. Sound ergonomic discipline has been employed to enhance the drive atmosphere for the occupants. The seats, door sides, front panel, steering wheel and the console have all been neatly designed for a harmonious image of elegance. The fully electric sports style seats are wide and comfortable, ensuring that thrills of speed go along with stress free comfort. Premium leather wraps the seats, giving an enriched drive feel for the occupants. A central armrest is present for both rows, promoting convenience for the length of the drive. Headrests are present for the front row occupants, blending comfort with safety. The driver gets the benefit of a sporty multifunction steering wheel. The ascending centre console is cool looking, and it impresses the distinctive feel of the cabin. There is a 4.6 inch screen above the instrument panel, which boosts the sophisticated image of the cabin. In addition to all of this, the interior space is embellished with wooden inlays, leather inserts and accents of aluminium and carbon. The brand is also offering an exhaustive range of personalisation options, allowing the customer to refine the look of the cabin according to his needs.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPacked under the hood is a 3.8-litre boxer engine that the company claims to have made from a superior lightweight metal design. This is a 6-cylindered engine with displacement capacity of 3800cc. Its performance is bolstered with two exhaust turbochargers that come along with variable turbine geometry. It is given the direct fuel injection system for efficient fuel transfer, and this function is further supported by a dry sump lubrication system. Going into technical specifications, the drive-train generates a power of 560bhp at 6500rpm to 6750rpm, together with a grinding torque of 700Nm at 2100rpm to 4250rpm. An efficient 7 speed gearbox transmits the power of the engine, allowing smooth shifting.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe car's integrity is preserved with quality for all facets of build, and this includes the braking and suspension systems. Six piston piston aluminium monobloc fixed calipers are rigged onto the front brakes, while four piston calipers secure the rear. In addition to this, cross drilled PCCB(Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake) brake discs further augment the car's braking performance. The Porsche Active Suspension Management system regulates the damping force on each wheel, thereby adding to the stability of the vehicle. The car is also gifted with a Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control, which improves the control quality when cornering and manoeuvring.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe adaptive sports seats come with electric adjustment, along with side bolsters, lumbar support and a memory package. The split folding rear seats also add utility to the cabin. A 12V power socket enables occupants to charge devices within the cabin. Also present are facilities such as cruise control, seat heating, illuminated vanity mirrors and cloth hooks. Available as standard is a BOSE surround sound system, which comes along with eight amplifier channels and 12 loudspeakers for the most engrossing audio experience. The Porsche communication management system acts as an interface for the audio, navigation and communication facilities within the car, giving optimal ease of usage for the occupants. The highlight of this feature is its intuitive colour touchscreen, which relieves hassle for the occupants. Also present with this system is a DCD audio drive that offers MP3 compatibility. An Aux-In facility, together with a USB port, allow passengers to integrate external devices with the system. Beside all of this, additional options include a mobile preparation system, a voice control system, a digital radio and a TV tuner.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe car wears a rigid bodyshell that reduces damage in case of a mishap. In addition to this, the anti lock braking system adds to the control quality when braking and cornering. Airbags provide critical shielding to the front passengers, and they come with a two stage inflation system for better use. Impact protection elements are incorporated in the doors for added protection in case of a sudden halt or a crash. In addition to this, there is a roll over protection system, which monitors the drive stability and deploys roll over bars in case the car loses balance.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Stunning exterior design and look.\u000a\u000a2. Excellent performance qualities.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. For its performance, it requires added safety measures.\u000a\u000a2. Its price range could deter buyers.\u000a...READ MORE

VPorsche 911 Turbo S review\u000a  Porsche 911 Turbo S is a mid range variant of the acclaimed 911 series. This car comes with an exhaustive list of features for its interior and exterior facets. A low height and slender shape ensure the right airflow, while the wide apron and rear spoiler help to maintain balance. The car is embellished with many plush design elements such as gloss lathed wheels, chrome tailpipes and the lustrous metallic skin. The cabin gives an enriched drive feel, with a host of equipment that serve the passengers' needs. The fine leather environment goes hand in hand with the comfort of power windows, a central locking system, and three 12V sockets. A two zone climate control renews the drive ambiance.

Additional control is granted with techno aids such as the Porsche traction management and the Porsche torque vectoring plus. The electromechanical power-assisted steering system also reinforces the car's handling and control.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe adaptive sports seats come with electric adjustment facility, 18 way side bolsters and memory function as well. Additional convenience is provided with the electrical adjustment of backrests, seat height, seat side bolsters and lumbar support.

VPorsche Cayman S Tiptronic review\u000a  Porsche Cayman S Triptronic is one of the variant in its model series. The company has moulded this vehicle with the same uncompromising policy on all facets. It is powered by a 3436cc engine, which comes with aluminium block and cylinder heads. The vehicle can glide to a top speed of 281kmph, and can touch the 100kmph mark in a mere 4.7 seconds. The car's look has been invigorated with its aerodynamic shape, strong body lines, alloy wheels and many other impressive factors. Its structural superiority also ensures a high level of safety when driving. The interiors have been delicately designed, giving a pleasant drive environment along with many comfort features. A two zone automatic climate control permeates the cabin with an enjoyable aura. An optional Burmester High-End Surround System and BOSE Surround Sound System are also present for quality entertainment. Also present are LED reading lights, three 12V sockets, a lockable glove compartment, and rich leather appliqus all over the space. The car has also been programmed with high-end drive systems. Beside the conventional ABS and EBD, it also has Porsche Stability Management, which consists of automatic brake differential, engine drag torque control and many others.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA car with the Porsche emblem retains a touch of genius with respect to looks, and this model accomplishes just that. Its slender build, streamlined silhouette and low profile make it the ideal speed machine, and at the same time, boost its appeal to the finest level. The prominent wings add a dynamic vision to the front, and this is further improved by the large air intakes at the bottom. The under-body paneling and a front spoiler lip add elements of function to the design. The circular headlamp clusters host Bi-Xenon light systems and a dynamic light system for added visibility. The large structure of the hood underlines the vehicle's masculine appeal, and this is further improved with sleek curvatures lines. Well sculpted fenders add to the vibrant look of the side. The roof line extends all the way to the rear area, making an imprint for the vehicle's distinctive character. A rear wing deploys when the vehicle crosses 120kmph.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe cabin is suffused with an aura of warmth and comfort. The steering wheel rim, the gear lever and the door handle inlays are done up with an expensive, smooth leather finish. The seats are dressed in fine Alcantara/Leatherete, ensuring a more prominent feel for the occupants during the drive. The 'Cayman' logo is present in front of the gear lever, imparting a more bold and distinctive feel for the cabin. The dashboard, center console, glove compartment, door release levers and air vent surrounds are polished with a Galvano silver finish. A more enriched quality is given by the roofliner. A fine leather treatment is also given to the door panel armrests and the center console storage compartment lid. The ascending center console adds a unique impression to the cabin, while at the same time, allowing an element of utility to it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe machine has been equipped with a 6 cylinder engine that has a raw displacement capacity of 3436cc. It generates a power of 325bhp, coupled with a torque of 370Nm. It has four valves per cylinder, and the presence of a hydraulic valves adjustment system aids in its working. The efficiency of the drive-train is enhanced with a VarioCam plus valve timing and lift facility. The direct fuel injection system ordains effective fuel transfer, and this is further improved with an integrated dry-sump lubrication system. A 7 speed PDK transmission ensures smooth shifting and better performance.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFour-piston aluminum monobloc fixed calipers are present by the front and rear wheels, and these discs are internally vented and cross-drilled for superior quality. Meanwhile, a lightweight spring strut axle strengthens the chassis arrangement, and it is supported by an anti roll bar at the front and rear. In addition to this, many reliable techno aids help to govern control, such as the anti lock braking system, electronic brakeforce distribution, and anti slip regulation.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aElectric windows relieve strain for the occupants, and they come with a one touch operation. Going along with this are electrically adjustable/heated exterior mirrors. The element of comfort is improved with an electric backrest adjustment facility for the seats, along with a height adjustment feature as well. Integral headrests have also been provided, supporting the occupants' heads and necks and discouraging injuries during mishaps. Vanity mirrors are present, along with sun visors. Cup holders in the dashboard give ease of storing beverages. A standard CDR audio system comes along with a CD radio, an Aux-In facility and a 7 inch touchscreen for the most exotic entertainment experience.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe headlights come with integral direction indicators, while the tail-lights have LED, brake indicators and reversing lights. Full sized airbags protect front occupants, while three point inertia reel seatbelts strap in all of the passengers. There is an ISOFIX by the passengers' side in addition to all of this. A Porsche Side Impact Protection incorporates elements of protection by the side and the doors. Beside all this, the car has a structurally integral bodyshell, which exerts a good level of safety on the occupants always. An alarm system and an engine immobilizer bring security to the vehicle as well.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Impressive outer design.\u000a\u000a2. Range of techno aids to promote control.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. The top speed for this variant is rather weak.\u000a\u000a2. In-cabin entertainment could be improved.\u000a...READ MORE

VLand Rover Range Rover Evoque SE review\u000a  Overall:\u000aLand Rover Range Rover Evoque SE is a base variant in this model series. It comes with a sound range of features for the cabin arrangement, the exterior cosmetics, the safety and all other sections of its build. Starting with the raw facet, its performance is governed by a 1999cc engine, which takes it to a top speed of 195kmph, and allows it to race from 0 to 100kmph in 8.5 seconds. Safety has been ordained with the presence of a lengthy list of features, from headrests to seatbelts and an advanced airbag coverage system.

This high rev engine is built as a six cylinder petrol format. Translating the massive engine capacity to speed is a seven gear dual clutch transmission system, specially designed for the needs of expensive machine. The inner prowess is balanced by the beauty that paints it from the outside: Its low profile is designed for aerodynamics and stealth on the streets. Its fluidic, streamlined shape gives it an imposing look rarely found on regular roads. Its trimmed front grille, stylistically shaped headlights and elegant bumper are all sure to bring it to the fore of all its viewers' eyes.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis coupe is built to bring the racing edge to our streets.

A black colored ornamental grille completes its attractive front profile. Its impressive front headlights are integrated with adaptive LED headlights, complete with four LED DRL light rings and accent lights. This, along with a high beam assistance, a headlight washer system, and a heat protection glazing merge the car's exterior looks with well developed functional elements to go alongside them.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe low build and stealthily shaped exteriors do not leave its interiors suffering. The insides are large and spacious, built for comfort, decorative and atmospherically fulfilled. Its seats are wide and robust, meant for both luxury and driving dynamics. The front of the cabin has redeveloped shell shaped seats with an illuminated M logo. The seats are trimmed for perfect ergonomics and body support during driving. An expensive carbon structure anthracite leather combination forms the upholstery of the coupe's inside. The interior trim is finished with a dazzling blue shadow, highlighted with an expensive black high gloss finish. A well designed dashboard sits upfront, with a well lit radio screen. Ambient lights with mood lights fill the cabin, ensuring not only a well lit, but an appropriately lit atmosphere for the passengers. The leather steering wheel is integrated with gear shift paddles. All in all, it comes with an interiors design that takes its passengers to a whole new world.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis vehicle is built to raise the stakes on the roads, armed with power and performance like a few others. The M TwinPower, Turbo, inline 6 cylinder engine is an engine matched by no other.

VBMW M Series X5 M review\u000a  BMW M Series X5 M is one of the SUV products in this "M" model series. This massive vehicle comes with an array of features with regards to both insides and outsides. It is powered by a mighty V8 engine that delivers formidable performance. Its speed capacities go along with firm safety features such as a brake assist, cornering brake control and an electric parking brake. The interior of the vehicle has been polished for an aura of class and lavishness. Richly detailed upholstery, inlays of wood and many other elements decorate the area. Anthracite headlining along with the M door sill finishes gives a more up-scale look to the cabin. Quality entertainment is also ordained, with a Bluetooth facility that links phones to the car's system and allows in-cabin call hosting. A Navigation system provides assistance for the drive, and it comes along with 3D maps. A vast range of comfort features have been included beside this, such as anti dazzle interior mirrors, gearshift paddles, roller sunblinds and lumbar supported seats. The vehicle makes a powerful exterior allure with its athletic cosmetics, especially with its bumpers. The striking grille, double spoke alloy wheels and glossy colour schemes render it a spectacular look altogether.\u000a...READ MORE

VLamborghini Aventador LP700 4 review\u000a  The world of vehicles has been honed to what it is today only with the pioneering and grit of its foremost leaders. And one of the greatest, if not the greatest, names in the automotive industry is the star-studded Lamborghini. Here is a company that has stood for nothing short of marvels in the realm of car building. And this company's extraordinary engineering takes a whole new edge with the Lamborghini Aventador . This is a vehicle built for embodying class and performance in one. A mighty V12 engine equips this machine, capable of a trembling displacement value of 6498cc. It can shoot to a jaw dropping top speed of 350kmph, and can accelerate from not to 100kmph in a stunning 2.9 seconds. This undoubtedly is one of the deadliest machines ever built. Coming to the vehicle's more subtle features, it reflects beauty and artistic elegance in the craft of its exterior build. Low and sleek, it is trimmed for the best performance with the gift of agility and grace on the roads. Its streamlined, bullet like shape is meant to dazzle all who lay eyes on it. The cockpit of the intense machine is flavored for a human touch to go along with the high speed thrills. The seats and comfortable and large, and the upholstery is of the very finest material. All put together, this is a vehicle that builds performance like no other vehicle on the road, and also delivers on a promise of ride atmosphere and pleasure for the driver. It is available in two variants, the LP 700 \u2013 4, and the LP 700 \u2013 4 Roadster. Both of which have almost the same qualities, save for the convertible format of the roadster.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLamborghini has modeled beauty like few vehicles ever have in history, with some of their other products standing for the most sensual exterior builds. In terms of exterior beauty, this model does not just stand true to its manufacturer's promise. It raises it by several levels. The Lamborghini Aventador LP700 4 is unanimously one of the most exquisitely designed machines made. It scores for its low profile, which even comes close to standards set by F1. It is sleek and built for agility on the roads. The front lights are angular, shaped in a triangular format. Right below this, positioned on either side of the frontage, are two large air vents, poised to provide maximum cooling to the intense engine. Its front bumper slides upwards and blends into the roof for the most seamless, fluidic shape possible. Its rear portion is raised a notch higher than the front, exacting a more balanced and crisp overall appearance. The rear lights are sleek and crisp, integrated with LED, turn lights and courtesy lights. Two rear air vents are poised right below them, large and bold. The word 'Lamborghini' is inscribed at the top of the rear profile, stylistically written in the standard, cursive format that the company emblems itself in. A single, wide exhaust pipe is positioned at the very bottom, sealing the overall appearance and also leaving a trace of arrogant prominence.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe ground shaking speed and performance of this vehicle does not leave it lacking in its vital, human feature. The interior of the machine is modeled for hosting elegance and comfort, giving the passengers the air of tranquility that they need for going along with the high speed raciness that the car is built for. Rich leather upholstery covers the seats, and also the steering wheel. An air of wealthy importance resonates inside the cockpit, with the interior kit, seat shell, and the dashboard kit made of carbon fiber. The interior kit also has a neo piano design, meant to uplift its passengers to the heights of elegance. The e-gears are available in multiple colors and designs, with the Lamborghini inscription on all of them. Carbon fiber floor mats are available in different color stitches, all of them made for the most homely atmosphere a machine could possibly give.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe Lamborghini Aventador LP700 4 is equipped with one of the most powerful engines in the entire world, a twelve cylinder powerplant reserved for the fastest machines on the road. The 6.5-litre, V12 engine has 48 valves, incorporated through the DOHC configuration. It fires the vehicle with a maximum power of 700hp. This, along with its peak torque of 690Nm locks this in as one of the fastest machines ever made. The engine's prowess translates to raw power with the help of an efficient 7-speed gearbox, that is also gifted with a dry double plate clutch facility. The cooling needs of the engine are take care of through an advanced water and oil cooling system in the rear with variable air inlets. The interior mechanisms of the engine are aided with a dry sump lubrication system that helps keep the interior format smooth always. All of this together helps in building performance beyond comparison for this vehicle. It can zip to the 100kmph mark within the mind blowing span of 2.9 seconds, an acceleration rate that only tails behind that of a handful of others. The machine can roar to a staggering top speed of 350kmph, taking its performance beyond all known bounds.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is a machine that displays aggression like few others on the roads, and its speed is controlled and guided with the aid of a top notch braking and control system. It achieves the finest control and handling with a blend of numerous features that it has been gifted with, both standard and advanced in nature. Advanced 6-cylinder brake calipers equip the front brakes, while 4-cylinder brake calipers affirm the rear ones. In addition to this standard adjustment, the car has a dual hydraulic circuit brake system with a vacuum brake booster that enables a great hold for the vehicle when braking. Its suspension system is also given the very best build. It has a front and rear mono tube damper with push rod system, meant to aid the vehicle's suspension and to bring better control. Going beyond all conventional features, it brings the aid of an anti-brake system to further level up performance and control.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe vehicle delivers a wild performance, but at the same time, does not forget the ride quality of its passengers. A wide array of comfort and convenience features decorate the interior of the car, ensuring that all necessities of the passengers are well tended to always. Flawlessly stitched, premium leather covers the seats. Polished carbon fiber makes the steering wheel and the instrument panel. The plush foot mats are also made of carbon fiber. It has an advanced multimedia system, also provided with a music interface kit. A digital audio broadcasting system ensures high signal radio airplay. The navigation system is aided with a high definition color display and an up-to-date map by the guide. A Bluetooth feature levels up the sophistication that the cabin stands for, complete with a special Bluetooth kit. The audio functions are enhanced with the presence of a USB connection for external devices. Beside all of these high tech instruments, the cabin is also loaded with simple functional features such as a CD loader kit, an iPod kit, a storage compartment in the center console and a heated electric seat kit. The air conditioning system is advanced, with vents strategically placed for maximum circulation. Climate control feature also trims the luxury provided by the air conditioning. All put together, this vehicle strives to combine the thrills of high speed with the joy of comforts and luxury to go along with the ride.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis is, arguably, one of the most lethal machines to set foot on city roads. As a result, it is ensured the firmest level of safety to go along with the package of might and speed that it makes for. It is made with a powerful body format of carbon fibre, equipped with impact resistance in its features. Dual airbags provide the best protection for the worst scenarios. Tight seatbelts equip the nominal drive safety needs of the passengers, strapping them in all through the way. A digital tyre pressure gauge aids the driver, allowing him to monitor the tyre pressure and to ensure that nothing is amiss. An emergency first aid kit sits within the car as well, ensuring that emergencies are well tended to. It has a satellite anti-theft system to lock in security of the vehicle as well, bringing a firm guard against possibilities of theft that may arise with a machine as grand as this one.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. It is gifted with performance that almost matches that of F1 vehicles.\u000a\u000a2. The most attractive build and exterior format.\u000a\u000a3. Great control that goes along with high speed benefits.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Its high performance leaves its mileage to suffer.\u000a\u000a2. With an exquisite exterior build for aerodynamic superiority, it has lesser inner space.\u000a\u000a3. It lacks comfort and convenience features inside of it.\u000a...READ MORE

VBentley Continental GT V8 S review\u000a  Bentley is a renowned British automaker, specialising in the luxury car division. It is among the most illustrious names in the automotive industry. The Continental GT is one of the company's current line up. This is the model often credited for the company's ascension into a major brand in the world. It is also the first model from the company to employ 'mass production' manufacturing techniques. The model is offered with a wide range of variants, and one among them is the Bentley Continental GT V8 S . The car is armed with a massive V8 engine, which allows for excellent performance characteristics as well as good fuel efficiency. Turning to the look of the vehicle, it has a sporty build that accentuates its majestic character. Going along with this are more plush design elements that make it stand out as a luxury car. The car's interiors have a stylish, rich appeal that caters to all ranges of passengers. The seats are of comfortable design and covered in fine quality upholstery. Beside this, many other unique decorative elements together improve the quality of the cabin and make for a truly animated ride experience. In addition to this, the cabin hosts vital entertainment and comfort features, which provide for the needs of the passengers and also add value to the ride experience.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe vehicle has a low and streamlined pose, adding a sporty flavour to its wide and hefty build. At the front, the gloss black radiator grille is striking in its appearance. Situated over this is the emblem of the company. On either side, there are two round headlamp units that add a classy touch to the frontage. The company has incorporated the headlamps with Bi-Xenon lights that come along with an LED main beam support function, ensuring optimum visibility through the drive. At the bottom section of the front, the wide air intakes provide cooling to the large engine, and also give an impressive look. The side profile is complemented by new, all-bright fenders that are further mated with 20 inch stylish alloy wheels. This is further elevated by the red painted brake callipers. The car's body houses clear, sporty lines that improve its majestic stance. There is an option of Beluga gloss door mirrors, which add to the grandeur of the exteriors. The haunch line has a sharp, modern format that creates a confident and sporting feel. The tail lights are of a modest design, and they come with LED light systems for optimum safety on the road during the drive. At the bottom of the rear section, two sets of double exhaust pipes finish off the vehicle's dashing look.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe vehicle's cabin captivates the passengers with a combination of stylish design and handy comfort features. The interiors are layered with a combination of carefully selected leather hides and smooth metal surfaces to deliver the luxurious feel. Furthermore, the Piano Black veneer is lacquered and sanded up to eighteen times to produce a truly flawless finish. Beside this, there are a range of additional veneer options to choose from, including options of carbon fibre and bright tint aluminium. The steering wheel introduces revised paddle-shift gear selectors and a new wheel shape to enable stronger grip. Behind it, the instrument panel and dashboard are designed to echo the flying wings of the brand's emblem.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe vehicle is powered by a 4-litre twin-turbocharged V8 engine that displaces 3993cc. Furthermore, it can generate a peak power of 521bhp at 6000rpm, and a max torque of 680Nm at 1700rpm. It is coupled with an eight speed automatic transmission for flawless shifting and better performance. Altogether, the engine carries the vehicle to a top speed of 309kmph. In addition to this, the car can go from stall to 100kmph in just 4.3 seconds. Beside sound performance, the engine also delivers a more economical fuel consumption. It has a mileage value of 9.3kmpl, which is notable for its segment. The engine is modelled with a special function wherein only four of its eight cylinders are operational at lower throttle levels.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis vehicle is blessed with superior quality braking and handling systems like any other model from Bentley. Iron brakes with red painted callipers are present for a superior control when driving. Beside this, it has a sports suspension setup, with an electronically adjustable height facility for smoother handling. Also aiding this are air springs with continuous damping control, which further eliminate road anomalies and make for a smoother drive.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe cabin is suited with many passenger oriented features that enhance ride pleasure. An advanced Infotainment system provides for the entertainment needs of the passengers. It is further aided by an 8 inch touchscreen in the centre console, which provides access to an integrated information and entertainment system. There is a 30 GB hard drive, which allows quick access to mapping data that is present along with landscape imagery. Also, live traffic data and online access for point of interest searches are also offered for the most uncompromising comfort quality for the passenger. Bluetooth connectivity is another highlight of the cabin. It allows for musical streaming through Bluetooth enabled devices, along with call hosting within the cabin for maximum ease during the drive.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDual airbags at the front provide optimum shielding for the driver and the co passenger. In addition to this, there are dual rear side mounted airbags for additional protection to the passengers. Headrests at the front and the rear enhance safety for the passengers' heads and necks. The windows have washers to secure visibility for the driver on wet conditions. Beside all of this, the company has provided the car with superior braking and suspension systems, which eliminate chances of hazards during the drive. An anti lock braking system grants added safety when braking and cornering. In addition to this, an electronic stability control function operates alongside the all wheel drive system to improve control and stability.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Powerful engine with superior performance\u000a\u000a2. Lavish cabin atmosphere with premium features.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Low ground clearance is disappointing.\u000a\u000a3. More comfort features can be given as standard.\u000a...READ MORE
