Starting with the cabin, the company has lavished the interior space with chrome accents all over it. The drive atmosphere is further enriched with fine upholstery. There are minimal changes done to the vehicle's exterior facet, save for the facetlift added to the front. This includes minor upgrades to the shape of the headlamps, giving a more stylish theme to the front portion. All the other facilities and features of the car have been retained. The front seats come with electrical adjustment functions, along with a memory facility for the driver.

In addition to all of this, the cabin is also blessed with strong safety elements that include an impact protection design scheme, three point seatbelts, a warning triangle with a first aid kit, and an ISOFIX child seat mounting. For added safety, the company has given it runflat tyres with reinforced side walls. Coming to the heavier side, the car is driven by a 2.0-litre turbocharged diesel engine. It propels the vehicle from zero to 100kmph within just 8.1 seconds, which is astonishing for its hefty size. Its speed prowess is matched by a highly qualified braking and suspension arrangement, along with numerous techno aids such as ABS and cornering brake control.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe car wears the signature design blueprint set by the company for most of its cars.

VMaruti Celerio VDi review\u000a  Our country\u2019s largest car maker, Maruti Suzuki India Limited has finally launched the diesel version of its much talked vehicle, Celerio in the Indian car market. This hatchback has finally made its entry into the automobile market with a 793cc, twin cylinder based engine under its hood. This power plant has the ability of churning out a maximum power of 47bhp and 125Nm of power and torque outputs respectively. The company has introduced it with four diesel trims and all are with a manual transmission gear box. It allows the car to produce an impressive mileage of about 27.62 Kmpl, when driven under standard conditions. Among them, Maruti Celerio VDi is the mid range variant, which is available with almost all features that are necessary for a safe and comfortable journey. This vehicle is placed in the economy hatchback segment and will compete with the likes of Hyundai Grand i10, Ford Figo, Chevrolet Beat and the upcoming hatchback Tata Kite. This latest hatch comes with a stylish body structure equipped with trendy cosmetics, which gives it a decent look. It is designed with a chrome radiator grille, body colored bumpers, a set of steel wheels with full wheel covers and so on. This variant is being sold in quite a few sparkling exterior paint options for the buyers to choose from. The list includes Glistening Grey, Cave Black, Sunshine Ray, Blazing Red, Cerulean Blue, Pearl Arctic White and a Silky Silver metallic finish. The company has managed to give a futuristic look to its front facade with some trendy styling. Coming to its internal section, it is designed in dual tone color scheme. The insides come with a decent cabin space and comfortable seating arrangement along with a futuristic design. Its two tone dashboard gives it a fresh new look to the cabin. Despite being a mid level variant in this model series, this particular trim comes with features including co-driver vanity mirror, manually adjustable outside mirrors, power windows and many other important functions. On the other hand, its braking and suspension mechanism are quite proficient. It keeps the vehicle well balanced and gives a comfortable driving experience. This hatchback is being sold with a standard warranty of twenty four months or 40000 Kilometers, whichever comes first. At the same time, this period can be extended for one or two year under its extended warranty plans by paying some extra cost to authorized dealer.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VFord Figo 1.5D Titanium MT review\u000a  The all new Ford Figo hatchback has made its way to the country's automobile market. When compared to its predecessor, its outer appearance is more appealing and even the features are up to the mark. In particular, this Ford Figo 1.5D Titanium MT variant comes with an array of aspects like an automatic air conditioner, MyFordDock system, audio unit, tachometer, and an accessory socket to name a few. Also, there are storage spaces offered like map pockets, cup and bottle holders. It is offered with a sufficient boot space that is good enough for placing luggage. Besides these, there are a number of attributes that aid in giving enhanced protection. Some of these include dual front airbags, keyless entry, three point seat belts, high mount stop lamp and door ajar warning. It is pretty sporty and aerodynamic in terms of its exterior design. The outer dimensions are generous with a long wheelbase and total width measuring 2491mm and 1695mm respectively. The frontage with a chrome garnished radiator grille and trendy headlight cluster looks quite bold, whereas style is added to its sides with a set of alloy wheels. Meanwhile, the things to notice in its rear end are the tail lamps, and a boot lid with company's emblem on it. A 1.5-litre diesel mill powers this vehicle and helps in generating a healthy fuel economy of 25.83 Kmpl. With 99bhp power and 215Nm torque, this motor delivers a superior performance on roads.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOn the outside, this hatch looks pretty decent, but its sleek styling and edgy design gives it a trendy appeal. The maker has designed its radiator grille with a lot of chrome, which only adds to its appearance. The bright headlamps are properly positioned on either sides of the grille and also have turn indicators. Then, the bumper comes equipped with a wide airdam and a couple of fog lamps. A very large windscreen at front provides a clear view and is also integrated with a pair of variable intermittent wipers that have a six speed setting. The character lines on its doors that stretch along with its length, brings a striking look to its side profile. Both the window sill and B-pillars are in black, while the handles and mirrors are painted in body color. Additionally, the mirrors are fitted with side turn blinkers for both safety and convenience. The 14 inch alloy wheels are the key attraction, which are further adorned with tubeless radials of size 175/65 R14. Moving to its rear profile, there is a wide windscreen with defogger and a spoiler equipped with a high mount stop lamp. The boot lid is engraved with an oval shaped company's logo and has well designed tail lamps surrounding it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe splendid interiors are based on a contemporary design theme and the single tone charcoal black color goes well with it. Other elements that compliment its overall look are the fabric inserts on door panels and lunar grey applique on door handles, and audio bezel. The dashboard is decent and integrated with a steering wheel and a center console that further houses an infotainment system. The air vents in the center are vertically shaped, while those in the corners are circular. The cluster display gives out notifications of water temperature, low fuel, distance to empty, maintenance as well as gear shift indicator. The seats provide enhanced comfort and these are covered with fabric upholstery. The height adjustment facility to driver's seat is a plus point, and the rear one too gets folding function. Apart from these, there are map pockets to front seats, rear parcel tray, boot lamp, and storage areas in doors with specialized compartments for cups as well as bottles.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis trim is offered with a 1.5-litre diesel motor that has a total displacement capacity of 1498cc. It is incorporated with a common rail fuel injection system. Having been paired with a five speed manual transmission gear box, it distributes power to front wheels. This oil burner gives an impressive mileage of 25.83 Kmpl on highways and about 22.4 Kmpl, when driven on traffic filled city roads. It can break the 100 Kmph speed mark in only about 13 seconds besides achieving a top speed of 150 Kmph approximately. The maximum power it can deliver is 99bhp at 3750rpm and the torque comes to 215Nm in the range of 1750 to 3000rpm.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIts suspension system comprising of coil spring, anti roll bar, twin gas as well as oil filled shock absorbers ensure a smooth driving experience. An independent McPherson strut is assembled on its front axle and the rear one gets a semi independent twist beam. In terms of braking, its front wheels are fitted with ventilated discs and drum brakes are used for the rear ones. The advanced anti lock braking system is also offered to further boost this mechanism. For effective handling, there is a tilt adjustable electric power assisted steering column. This supports the minimum turning radius of 4.9 meters.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis mid range variant is equipped with several practical features such as front sunvisors with vanity mirrors, 12V power socket, guide me home headlamps, tachometer and power operated windows with one touch up and down function on driver's side. The MyFordDock allows to integrate devices like navigation system and MP3 player to the entertainment unit. Also, there are power fold mirrors, which can be folded effortlessly just with the touch of a button. The automatic air conditioner is useful for bringing down the temperature inside with great ease. Then, there is an audio unit with FM/AM radio tuner, USB port and auxiliary input options.

VChevrolet Sail Hatchback 1.2 LS review\u000a  Chevrolet Sail Hatchback 1.2 LS is a variant in the already prevailing Chevrolet hatchback series. It is introduced as a replacement for hatchback Aveo UVA. As it failed to grab the eye-balls. As a result of this, the General Motors company has came up with this hatchback for India. It is placed in the premium hatchback segment where it is competing against Toyota Etios Liva, Nissan Micra, Skoda Fabia, Maruti Ritz, Volkswagen Polo and Tata Indica Vista. This particular trim looks splendid and is powered with a Smartech 1.2-litre DOHC petrol engine with 4 cylinders placed in-line formation. The engine of the hatch is capable of churning out a power of 82.45bhp at 6000rpm and produces a maximum torque of 108.5Nm at 5000rpm. The powertrain comes mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. Externally its appearance is dominated by the chrome highlighted frontage featuring golden bowtie, hawk-wing styled headlamps along with body toned bumpers, door handles and mirror housings. Cabin is brimmed with elements such as multiple storage spaces, stylish steering wheel, chrome accents on handles, AC vents and center stack. Apart from possessing an air-conditioner unit, there are front electrically operated windows, power steering, adjustable seats, power socket and headrests. Central door lock, key-less entry and engine immobilizer guard the car while the protection of the occupants can be safely reliable over the features like speed sensitive door locks, child protection locks, seatbelts and reminders. This variant can be considered to be a perfect small car for a reasonable price tag.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe hatchback is larger in size than most of the others present in the segment, with a length of 3946mm, width of 1690mm and a height of 1503mm. The ground clearance of the vehicle is 174mm and the wheelbase is 2465mm. The front fascia of the hatchback sports the company's design scheme that can be seen across models. At the front one can see the usual honeycomb grille, which has a golden bowtie in the center. One can see chrome bordering the grille, adding to the premium look of the hatchback. Giving the hatch its good looks are the swept back headlamps, round fog lamps, which are mounted on the front bumper. The side profile has a backward sloping roofline that adds to its sporty silhouette. The rear end looks flat and has an attractive design, as opposed to its edgy front. It runs on 14 inch steel wheels covered with 175/70 R14 tyres. Looking at the size of the car, 14inch tyres seem to be a little smaller.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOwing to its large size and a huge wheelbase, it has a lot of space in the cabin. When we say space, not just the front seats have enough legroom, but also the rear seating has an extremely good spacing along with a very good under-thigh support to the seats. The boot volume of the car is close to 248-litres, which is extremely good considering the competition that it faces in its segment. If the rear seat is folded, then this volume increases to about 1134 litres, which is massive. The interiors are two tone and there are lot of chrome inserts, which one can see. The look and feel of the cabin is plain and simple with no flashy stuff on the dashboard or anywhere else. The center console is also conventional and simple. The console consists of a music system with lesser buttons, giving it a neat and tidy look. The air-conditioning unit is complimented by well placed vents, which has chrome rings to them. The seats have been covered by fabric upholstery and are very cozy to sit on. Instrument panel has a blue illumination to it.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt is powered by a 1.2-litre SMARTECH petrol engine that is based on a dual overhead camshaft valve system. This mill comprises of 4 in-line cylinders and has a displacement capacity of 1199cc . It is capable of producing a power of 82.45bhp at 6000rpm and delivers a maximum torque of 108.5Nm at 5000rpm. This output is transmitted to the front wheels through a five speed manual gearbox.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis hatchback uses ventilated discs with caliper brakes in the front and drum type brakes in the rear. Though, this trim has been made simple, there seems to be no compromises with the braking system. It has ABS with EBD for additional support. The McPherson Strut with coil spring and stabilizer bar are assembled to the front axle. While the rear gets semi-independent suspension with coil springs. This suspension system along with power steering in this variant makes the drive very comfortable and quite smooth. The car is quite responsive, which adds to the pleasure of driving.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt has a lot of amenities that include power assisted steering system and power windows integrated to all the four doors. Tilt adjustable steering wheel is bestowed for the convenience of the driver and another support feature is that the external mirrors can be internally adjusted. Remote key-less entry, central door locking system are few other advantages. The front seats have headrests that are height adjustable and on the other hand, the rear seat has flexible flat folding facility and 60:40 split folding feature as well. Apart from the standard cabin's courtesy lamp there is a lamp in the trunk room too. Along with the rear parcel shelf, there are few other storage spaces available. Other add ons are remote fuel filler and tailgate release functions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aLike all general motor's cars this hatchback irrespective of its simplicity, does not compromise with the safety features. This hatch has an anti-lock braking system with electronic braking distribution that helps enhance the braking system of the car and improves the handling and control over the car. There is also a stability traction control and dual airbags for the safety of the passengers. It has fog lamps, which will help to improve the safety and visibility even during tough weather conditions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. New and improved designing.\u000a\u000a2. A decent car for families\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Low on comfort features.\u000a\u000a2. Poor after sale maintenance.\u000a...READ MORE

This MPI mill comprises of 3-cylinders based on DOHC valve configuration and it is integrated with a turbocharger. This enables it to produce an immense power of 74bhp at 5400rpm that results in a pounding torque output of 110Nm at 3750rpm. The automaker has skilfully mated this motor to a five speed manual gearbox that sends out the torque output to its front wheels. At the same time, it helps the vehicle to give away a peak mileage of approximately 16.47 Kmpl, which is rather decent.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe automaker has blessed this vehicle with a rack and pinion based electric power assisted steering system, which is further integrated with speed dependent control and supports a minimum turning radius of just 4.97meters.

After Alto K10 and Celerio, this is the next model that includes this latest clutch free gearbox. Just like its previous version, it has a pretty body design on the outside with Silver finished roof rails, Blue tint headlights and body colored ORVMs. The only change comes in the form of an 'Auto Gear Shift' lettering at its rear end. Inside, this model gets dual tone 3D effect plush upholstery and Silver treated instrument panel as well as door handles. It has a spacious cabin with a wheelbase of 2400mm, where a total of 5 occupants can be seated easily. This runabout gets a boot space of 180-litres that can also be increased further by folding rear seat. Moreover, there are map pockets, front seats with reclining and sliding facility. This trim bestows impressive security for the occupants with high mounted stop lamp, child proof rear door locks and collapsible steering column. Under the hood, it is powered by a 998cc petrol engine based on a DOHC valve configuration, including three cylinders. This hatchback has a kerb weight of 885 Kilogram, while its gross weight stands at 1350 Kilogram. \u000a...READ MORE

There are several other safety elements present includes child proof rear door locks to indicators for fuel consumption, distance to empty and a gear position indicator as well. The cabin has been suffused with an aura of warmth and comfort. A 4 speaker stereo system provides quality entertainment, and this is further augmented by Bluetooth for in-cabin calling and audio streaming. A Urethra 3 spoke steering wheel is mounted with controls for the audio system. The car is also equipped with power windows, a tachometer, amber illumination for specific areas, a central door locking system, a fuel lid opener, and an antenna at the top for the most effective functioning.

The K-Series engine is available with a five speed manual transmission and comes with 3-cylinders having 4-valves each. The 2400mm wheelbase enables to achieve a tremendous turning radius of only 4.6 meters, which is really less as compared to the other competitors.

VHyundai Grand i10 CRDi Era review\u000a  Hyundai Motors India Limited has launched yet another model in the car market of India. This time it has rolled out a hatchback model christened as Hyundai Grand i10 and it is made available with both petrol and diesel engine options. There are several trim levels available in this model out of which Hyundai Grand i10 CRDi Era is the base level diesel model that is powered by a second generation U2 diesel power plant. This is perhaps the most affordable diesel engine rolled out by the company and it is based on CRDi (common rail direct injection) technology. The company claimed that this CRDi U2 diesel mill has the ability to return a class leading mileage of about 24 Kmpl, (as per ARAI certification). On the other hand, this entry level trim is blessed with all the basic stuff that meets the requirements of regular needs of the passengers on the move. The exterior design of this hatchback is rather good and it shares the design elements extracted from Hyundai i10 and Hyundai i20 hatchback model series. The company believes that the all new Hyundai Grand i10 is going to be the game changer in the automobile market of India.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aComing to the design and appearance of Hyundai Grand i10, it looks pretty much alike the Hyundai i20 hatch from its frontage. The front fascia has a newly styled headlight cluster, which is incorporated with powerful headlamps and turn indicators. Then there is a small yet stylish radiator grille, which is incorporated with a chrome plated strip along with a prominent company logo in it. The bumper is quite simple yet sportier, which will be liked by the car enthusiasts. On the side profile of this base trim, steel wheels have been fitted to the wheel arches and are assembled with tubeless tyres. The door handles and the external rear view mirrors are garnished in black color. Furthermore, there are side protective moldings fitted on to the door that gives protection, while enhancing the style of the side profile. When it comes to the rear profile, this hatchback is blessed with a trendy bumper painted in body color and fitted with reflectors. The boot lid and the windshield are very trendy, while the taillight cluster is very stylish that compliments the rear profile.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAs far as the interiors are concerned, the all new Hyundai Grand i10 CRDi Era entry level trim is blessed with plush interiors that gives a pleasant feel to the occupants. The company blessed its interior cabin with dual tone beige and black color scheme along with blue back light illumination. Also there are front and rear door map pockets and a front room lamp present inside the cabin that enhances the conveniences. This hatchback has been built on an impressive wheelbase of about 2425mm and an impressive width of about 1660mm that helped the designers to create more leg room and shoulder space inside the cabin. This hatchback has been built to offer a lavish seating arrangement for at least five passengers. There are few noticeable features offered with this hatch including an air conditioner along with AC vents on dashboard, a multi-information display, internally adjustable ORVMs and so on.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe all new Hyundai Grand i10 CRDi Era, base level trim is blessed with a second generation U2, 1.1-litre, CRDi based diesel mill, which is designed, especially for the Indian conditions. Despite being a smaller engine, it produces a commanding power of about 70bhp at 4000rpm, while yielding 160Nm of torque in between 1500 to 2750rpm. This engine has been coupled with a five speed manual gearbox that sends the engine power to the front wheels. The company proudly claims that all new Hyundai Grand i10 powered by this U2 diesel mill can return a class leading 24 Kmpl of mileage, which is very impressive.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis all new Hyundai Grand i10 CRDi Era base level trim has been rolled out with a proficient braking and robust handling aspects, which eventually offers top rated driving dynamics. This disc and drum braking mechanism is perhaps the most efficient system, which you can rely on. On the other hand, the front axle is blessed with McPherson Strut suspension system and the rear axle is coupled with coupled torsion beam axle type of suspension system. This suspension mechanism adds stability to the vehicle and improves its agility on roads. Handling has been made easier, thanks to the motor electric power steering system that responds quickly and helps you to escape traffic with utmost ease.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis entry level trim in the Hyundai Grand i10 model lineup has been bestowed with all the basic features that assures utmost comfort to all the passengers. a multi-information display, a tachometer, front power outlet, front power windows, internally adjustable ORVMs, front passenger seat back pocket and several other such features.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThere are not many safety aspects included in this base level trim, which is a bit disappointing for the customers. The headlamps are very powerful that ensure good visibility ahead. Apart from this, the company has incorporated a sophisticated engine immobilizer system that would keep it safe from theft and any unauthorized entry.\u000a\u000aImpressive mileage, engine power and performance is good, price is very attractive.\u000aSafety features are poor, comfort features are not up to the mark.\u000a...READ MORE

VNissan Micra XV CVT review\u000a  Nissan Micra AT is the automatic gear box based trim with quite a lot of features. Its exteriors have aspects like alloy wheels, body colored outside door mirrors and chrome finished lower front grille. Inside the cabin, this vehicle gets fascinating cosmetics, such as piano Black finished center console, chrome inserted door handles, sporty dashboard and much more. Apart from captivating furnishings, it also comes with noteworthy comfy features, including automatic air conditioning, push button start, drive computer and driver seat with height adjusting facility. The car maker provides an impressive security for its passengers with dual front airbags, engine immobilizer, antilock braking system and follow me home headlights. McPherson struts are offered to the front axle, while a torsion beam is given to its rear end. Under the hood, this variant incorporates a 1.2-litre in-line petrol engine that is good enough in churning out 76bhp. A 5-speed automatic transmission is paired to this mill that sends the power to its front wheels. This runabout has a standard warranty for a limited period of time or distance that can further be increased by taking an extended warranty program.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VRenault Pulse Petrol RxL review\u000a  The cars manufactured by Renault have always been successful in staying with the trend by introducing new and updated versions. They have launched a new version of their hatchback, Pulse that is a combination of style incorporated with performance. This hatch series is available in both petrol and the diesel variants for the buyers to choose from. Its Renault Pulse Petrol RxL is the petrol variant, which is powered by a 1.2-litre motor. The interiors have got a comfy seating that makes one prefer to be in the car than step out of it. The storage capacity is also addressed as it has a decent boot space. This hatchback is an advanced version of its regular versions, which is offered in 6 different stunning colors, widening the choice of the buyers. It has an advanced in-car entertainment system featuring a music system with slight improvement that supports various players. Then there are body colored bumpers that improves the look of this utility. All the theft related vulnerabilities are put to a check, as it is integrated with an immobilizer. Furthermore, the safety factor is also improvised by fitting air bags, anti child lock safety system and a great braking technology. The convenience of the driver is improved by providing many automated functions like internal fuel lid lever and follow me home lamps. Sporting a few more comfort and safety functions, this trim has a potential of receiving a huge response from all sections of commuters.\u000a...READ MORE

VRenault KWID RXL review\u000a  Renault India, a subsidiary of the French automobile company, has a respectable market share in the country. To further improve its ground in India, it has launched a new hatchback, which is perhaps its least expensive product.

VMaruti Celerio VXI AT review\u000a  Maruti Suzuki India Limited has officially introduced a new member in its portfolio christened as Celerio. This latest model is available in various trim levels among which Maruti Celerio VXi AT comes as the mid level variant. This trim is assembled with a 1.0-litre, 3-cylinder, K10B engine that is coupled with a 5-speed auto gear shift box. This is just another type of manual gearbox that doesn't require the use of a clutch, thereby makes it easy for the driver, while maneuvering in heavy traffic conditions with zero possibility of car stopping. According to the company, this latest hatch can produce an attractive mileage figure of about 23.1 Kmpl, which is an added advantage of this vehicle. On the other hand, this particular variant comes with rather basic features such as a manual AC unit with heater, a responsive power steering, fabric upholstered seats, a large glove box unit along with other storage spaces and so on. However, the company blessed this trim with some significant safety features including an engine immobilizer unit, a central locking system, high mount stop lamp and quite a few others.\u000a...READ MORE

VMaruti Wagon R AMT VXI Option review\u000a  The Maruti Wagon R AMT VXI Option is a new variant added to this successful model line up. The interior and exterior faces of the car remain unchanged, but the engine is joined to a new automatic manual transmission. A new ABS system along with dual front airbags are notable upgrades to this version. The interior boasts the same stash of features, from the 12V socket to the glove box and foldable utility hook. An integrated music system is a prized element of the cabin environment, and it comes with a digital clock and a USB input. The Urethrane 3 spoke steering wheel has a silver finish for a more expensive look, and this goes along with a contemporary AC vent design. The amber speedometer illumination also underscores the car's new age modeling. For an easier drive, the digital fuel indicator comes with a double trip meter, and a tachometer also promotes convenience. The safety of the vehicle has been strengthened with a child proof rear door locks, a washer and defogger for the rear window, and an intelligent computerized anti theft system. Also present is a security system which governs the safety of the machine and prevents hazards of theft.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe vehicle makes a mark with its modern and stylish outfit, which is, at the same time, tailored for a sporty identity. The robust format along with the square lines give it a new avenue of appeal. Its distinctive touch is further bolstered by the fine design themes that help to replenish its vibrant image. At the front, the newly designed front bumper makes for a good look, along with the blue tinted headlamps. The grille is enhanced with a new chrome treatment. The fog lamps at the bottom add to the visibility function, and they are positioned flanking a wide air intake section. The flared wheel fenders impart a more invigorated look, and they help to accentuate the effect of the cool wheel rims. For this variant, there are full wheel covers that come along with the S badging. The side body moldings also add to the renewed look, while the body colored mirrors and door handles help to bring unity in the design statement. The amber colored side indicators also add mojo to the look. At the rear, this variant is graced with a chrome back door garnish, and the moon rock silver roof rails compliment the look altogether.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe cabin is reasonably large, and it has dual beige and black color scheme that is complimented by 3D effect plush upholstery. The instrument panel area and the door handles have elements of silver treatment, and this makes for a far more enriched design theme. The seats and the gear knob have been implemented with an ergonomic design, giving more comfort to the operational aspects. Further, there is a molded roof lining, which goes along with the sophisticated vision of the place. The doors have been appraised with a fabric trim which adds to the interior look. The needle punch floor carpet builds utility for the occupants, and, at the same time, escalates the plush value of the cabin.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIt is packed with a K10B engine with an all aluminum light weight design. Build of 3 cylinders and 12 valves incorporated together, the train displaces 998cc, a decent figure for this class. Added specifications include a power of 67bhp at 6200rpm, and a torque of 90Nm at 3500rpm. For this new variant, the brand has charged the engine through a clutch-free automatic manual transmission that gives efficient performance and hassle free shifting.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe chassis arrangement is reinforced with a McPherson strut on the front axle and an isolated trailing link for the rear axle. Coil springs have been mounted upon both axles, promoting an even more strain free experience. Coming to the braking facet, ventilated discs secure the front brakes, while drum units have been rigged onto the rear. In addition to this, the electronic power steering system helps to cement control even further.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA range of features together build comfort and convenience for the occupants, from the adjustable tilt steering system, electrical OVRMs to the power windows at the front and rear. A central door locking feature blends safety with comfort. Wide opening doors also make for easier boarding and dismounting for the occupants. The front seats come with a reclining and sliding full flat function for the added convenience of those occupants, and this goes along with the benefit of headrests and doorside armrests. The rear seats are built in a 60:40 split arrangement, and by virtrue of this, added space can be made for storing luggage by the rear when needed. Three foldable assist grips are also present, along with a front passenger under seat tray, and a push type I/P storage box. The floor console comes with cup holders, the front doors come with map pockets and the front passenger seat comes with a back pocket.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFor this variant, the Anti lock braking system helps to improve control, while new dual airbags at front provides critical shielding to the front occupants. The collapsible steering column is also a benefit for the safety requirements of the drive, along with the front and rear wipers. The 3 point ELR seatbelts grant additional safety, along with the seatbelt warning lamp for the driver's seat. Aside from all of this, this vehicle comes with an energy absorbing body template that includes side impact beams. The halogen lamps, the leveling device, and the front and rear fog lamps make driving in the dark completely strain free.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Range of comfort features within.\u000a\u000a2. Fuel economy poses as a bonus.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. The exterior look needs improvement.\u000a\u000a2. Lack of additional techno aids could be viewed as a drawback.\u000a...READ MORE

VMaruti Wagon R Stingray LXI Optional review\u000a  Maruti Suzuki is one of the most trusted brands in India famous for coming out with budget friendly cars. Its wagon R hatchback has already gained tremendous interest from Indian buyers. In order to raise the selling graph, the car maker applied some cosmetic updates over this model and named it as Wagon R stingray, which gives direct competition to the likes of the Hyundai i10 and Ford Figo. This recently added trim, Maruti Wagon R Stingray LXI Optional is blessed with two advanced safety features, such as dual front airbags and an Antilock Braking System (ABS). From the visual perspective, it allures the enthusiasts at a glance with the horizontally slatted grille that makes its face look sophisticated by combining a pair of expressive headlights. Interior looks quite decent as well with single tone treatment, comprising of a sporty dashboard and an instrument cluster with noteworthy warnings to assist the driver. The occupants can enjoy a comfortable drive with an air conditioner, central door locking and foldable rear seats. Powered by a 998cc petrol engine, this runabout is capable of making 90Nm torque. It is mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox and has a fuel tank capacity of 35-litres. The company is offering 2 years or 40000 Kilometers (whichever comes earlier) basic warranty on this vehicle that can also be increased further by taking an extended warranty program from its authorized dealer.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWhat grabs attention at first glance is the face that has been designed slightly differently in order to be aggressive with reflector grille, including Suzuki emblem in the centre. Apart from rendering an appealing aspect, this grille also enhances the driving experience in the dark by reflecting light of the vehicle coming in opposite direction. One more striking cosmetic is bestowed to its front in the form of sleek headlight clusters that are fitted with first in segment projector unit. There are stunning bumpers and door handles in overall shade, while side turn indicators are painted in White color. Moreover, this runabout comprises of a high mounted stop lamp, B-pillar Black out strip and a good side skit. A set of 155/65 tubeless radials wrapped with 14 inch steel wheels add to its beauty from the side profile which also come with full wheel covers, incorporating 'S' badging in the centre. Its rear end is adorned by decent spoiler, flat boot lid with chrome inserted logo and the same furnishing is applied on its stylish tail lamps. This variant has a minimum turning radius of 4.6 metres, ground clearance of 165mm and wheelbase of 2400mm.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe entire theme is based on Black color that gives an appealing glimpse with a sporty dashboard, chrome accentuated AC vents and Blue illuminated instrument cluster. Ergonomically designed seats are dressed with 3D effect upholstery and offer a comfy journey for a total of five passengers, it also comes with adjustable headrests. Door handles get chrome treatment, while trims wear the finest fabric materials. Sunvisors with ticket holder comes for driver, whereas it includes vanity mirror for co-passenger. Other features include an ergonomic gear knob, luggage parcel tray, floor console with cup holder, moulded roof lining and needle punch floor carpet. There is a multi information display in order to make you aware of the exact distance travelled, average fuel efficiency and distance to empty.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aUnder the hood you get a 1.0-litre petrol engine that is based on a DOHC valve configuration, including a total of three cylinders. This mill has a displacement capacity of 998cc and can produce a maximum power of 67.04bhp at 6200rpm along with a peak torque of 90Nm at 3500rpm which is quite decent. It gets an MPFI fuel supply system that makes it capable of returning mileage of 17.08 Kmpl in city and 20.51 Kmpl on the highway. In just 15 seconds, this runabout can make 100 Kmph from a standstill and then, can attain a top speed of 150 Kmph.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIts front wheels are paired to ventilated discs, which get holes on both sides in context of providing better cooling to the plates and balance the deficiency of drum brakes affixed with rear ones. Further, this system has been improved by Antilock Braking System (ABS) that monitor all wheels very smartly in order to avoid lock ups under hard braking. There is a pair of McPherson struts at front axle, while isolated trailing links are fitted to the rear position. Coil springs come at both axles for added comfort. This suspension mechanism makes the vehicle capable of dealing with all kinds of irregularities with relative ease.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis machine is loaded to give you a comfy ride with electric power steering, foldable grip assist, and front power windows. The car maker has conferred central door locking to access all doors simultaneously. Its tail gate as well as fuel tank can be locked and unlocked without walking out of the vehicle. The front seats have reclining and sliding functions along with pockets in their back. Moreover, map spaces are available in the first row's doors, while storage shelf comes only for its driver. In order to keep a better balance of temperature inside the cabin, this model includes an air conditioner with heater and rotary AC controls. The passengers can make the volume of its boot compartment more than 180-litres by folding its rear seat.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis variant is blessed with two vital features, including ABS and dual front airbags. Apart from these, all aspects are same as the earlier model. Just like the ongoing LXI variant, it gets energy absorbing body structure with side impact beams, collapsible steering column, front fog lamps, head leveling device for its headlights and front wiper with a 2-speed intermittent. Furthermore, this variant comprises of an intelligent computerized anti theft system (i-CATS), driver seatbelt warning indicator, front and rear ELR seat belts.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Safety features are impressive.\u000a\u000a2. Fuel efficiency is good.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Comfort features can be enhanced.\u000a\u000a2. Ground clearance is slightly lesser than its competitors.\u000a...READ MORE

VMaruti Alto K10 VXI review\u000a  For further increasing the number of sales in car market, MSIL has launched the facelifted version of its popular hatchback K10 with minor updates. It is being sold with both manual and automatic transmission gear box. Among several variants, Maruti Alto K10 VXI is the top end trim in its model line up. The exterior changes includes a redesigned radiator grille with a single chrome slat, revamped bumper and a new headlight cluster. At the same time, the internal cabin gets a dual tone dashboard, which is equipped with a new steering wheel and redesigned AC vents. The company has not made any changes to its technical specification. It comes with the same 1.0-litre petrol engine under the bonnet, which has a displacement capacity of 998cc. It is coupled with a five speed manual transmission gear box, which allows it to deliver 67.04bhp of power along with a torque output of 90Nm. The braking and suspension mechanism of this hatchback are quite proficient, which keeps it well balanced at all times. At present, it is being sold in several color options, which are Silky Silver, Fire Brick Red, Superior White along with the new Granite Grey, Tango Orange and Cerulean Blue finish. This small car has a budget friendly price range and competes against the likes of Chevrolet Spark, Hyundai Santro Xing, Datsun Go and Hyundai Eon. It is being offered with a standard warranty of two years or 40000 Kilometers, whichever comes first. While the buyers can also avail an extended warranty of one year or 60000 Kilometers at a nominal cost.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VVolkswagen Polo 1.5 TDI Comfortline review\u000a  Overview:\u000aVolkswagen India has launched the face lifted version of Polo just ahead of the Auto Expo 2016. This is one among the top players in the country's hatchback segment, which takes strong challenge from Maruti Baleno, Hyundai Elite i20 and Fiat Punto Evo. By introducing this upgraded version, the automaker hopes to extend the market share further. However, these latest improvements are reserved only for its top end Highline trim. But this mid range variant too carries some interesting elements, which makes it a decent buy.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VChevrolet Beat Diesel LS review\u000a  Chevrolet India has silently launched the facelifted version of its low cost hatch Chevrolet Beat at the Indian Auto Expo 2014 in New Delhi. The latest version of Beat comes with minor cosmetic updates, while its technicalities remained unchanged. The company made changes to both the interiors and exteriors of this hatch, while retaining all the features of the outgoing model. The manufacturer is offering it in four trim levels with petrol and diesel engine options for the customers to choose from. The Chevrolet Beat Diesel LS is one of the mid level variant and it is powered by a 3-cylinder, DOHC based 1.0-litre diesel motor that is capable of giving away 25.44 Kmpl of mileage. This particular trim gets a redesigned radiator grille up front along with a revamped headlight cluster and a new newel effect tail lamp that gives it a refreshing new look. There is no update given to the interior section of this hatch. The manufacturer is offering a 3-years/1,00,000 kilometers warranty (whichever is earlier). By launching this latest version, the company will expect improved sales in market.\u000a...READ MORE

VHyundai Grand i10 CRDi Magna review\u000a  The Hyundai Grand i10 model series is the latest hatchback in the Indian automobile market and it has been launched in both petrol and diesel variants. There are quite a few diesel variants for the buyers to choose from which are available in its portfolio out of which this Hyundai Grand i10 CRDi Magna is the mid range trim in its model series. The company has equipped this diesel variant with a second generation 1.1-litre, U2 diesel engine that is designed for Indian roads for greater fuel efficiency. The company promises a maximum fuel efficiency of about 24 Kmpl (as per ARAI certification), which seems to be an added asset of this diesel hatch for the buyers. The company believes that the new Hyundai Grand i10 hatch is going to be a best seller in the Indian automobile market very soon. Coming to the exterior appearance, this newly launched Hyundai Grand i10 looks very sleek and stylish with design elements of the brand on its front and rear. This hatch is much bigger in terms of length, width and wheelbase in comparison to the existing Hyundai i10 model. Hence, the occupants will have ample space inside the cabin. The company has furbished the interior cabin with a trendy looking beige and black color scheme and it is complimented by blue interior illumination. This hatch will now lock horns with the likes of Nissan Micra, Maruti Swift, Maruti Ritz, Toyota Etios Liva and other such contenders in the automobile market.\u000a...READ MORE

VMaruti Celerio Green VXI review\u000a  Maruti Suzuki India Limited has officially launched its first CNG version Maruti Celerio in the country's automobile markets. This latest version is available with all the features that are standard in the petrol VXI variant. Powering this trim, is the same 1.0-litre K10B aluminum petrol engine, which is presently under the hood of all its existing versions. It is also accompanied with a CNG fuel kit, which enhances its fuel efficiency to 31.7 Km/kg, which is remarkable. However, under the CNG mode, the power output goes down to 57bhp along with the torque output of 77Nm, which may not be a concern for the buyers. The car maker has introduced only one variant in the form of Maruti Celerio Green VXI and it is available with a 5-speed manual gearbox. This hatchback which was launched just few months back, is being doing pretty well for the company in terms of sales. Now in a bid to garner more sales, the company has introduced this CNG version that is said to be the most fuel efficient in its class. On the other hand, the company has retained its exterior and interior design like the other existing variants. This vehicle will now compete with the likes of Chevrolet Beat, Ford Figo and others in the entry level segment.\u000a...READ MORE

VTata Nano XT review\u000a  The Tata brand stands out for pioneering new vehicles, which are cost efficient and do not compromise on quality. One of their small car, Nano has performed decently well in terms of sales and market shares in our country. It has been given a facelift and one of its variant is the Tata Nano XT. There have been several changes made to its exteriors, interiors and features as well. This variant is packed with a 2-cylinder petrol engine, which has a displacement value of 624cc. The external build is just as strong as it had always been. This new version is refurbished at the front, and this renders a more stylish look to its overall profile. The insides are complete on all luxury and convenience needs of its passengers. It has a audio unit with a USB input, and all other necessities. The upholstery is cut out for the finest elegance, while a host of techno aids are also present such as a driver information display and an electronic tripmeter.\u000a...READ MORE

VHonda Jazz 1.2 SV i VTEC review\u000a  Honda Jazz is the latest newcomer hatchback model in our country's market. It competes with the likes of Hyundai Elite i20, Volkswagen Polo, Fiat Punto Evo and a few others in this segment. It is available with both petrol and diesel engine's, with Honda Jazz 1.2 SV i VTEC being its mid range petrol variant. It is incorporated with a 1.2-litre petrol engine that generates 88.76bhp in combination with torque of 110Nm. This mill is paired with a 5-speed manual transmission gear box that helps in returning a decent mileage of around 18.7 Kmpl. The firm has offered it with various safety aspects like dual front SRS airbags, central locking, ACE body structure, and rear window defogger to name a few. This trim has attractive interiors, which is decorated in a dual tone color scheme. The center console is designed elegantly, while the other equipments on dashboard like music system, steering wheel and air vents gives a modern feel to its cockpit. A fine quality fabric upholstery covers its seats, whereas the storage spaces add to the convenience of its occupants. Its exteriors too, look quite stylish with a bold front radiator grille that is surrounded by large headlamps. On the sides, it includes door mirrors as well as a set of 15 inch steel wheels. On the whole, its striking design combined with many noticeable features gives the best look to this hatchback.\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VRenault Pulse RxZ review\u000a  This vehicle, the Renault Pulse RxZ , that is modified to the level of luxury standards is what one expects to pop out into the automotive market and as the name suggest, it does hold one's pulse off the beats. Offered in petrol and diesel variants, to the daily commuters, this hatchback is a super car in its category. The interior decoration has been very minutely handled and the effort that has been gone into making this baby can be seen on the classic finish that it holds. Just sitting on couch like seats that are ultra comfy and driving off is not one needs. Some music would help a lot in not falling off to sleep on the job and that is handled by the advanced music system that is decked to this cruise. With a powerful motor, this machine is beastly in its performance. And adding to the robust mechanism, the ABS with EBD along with brake assist will do the rest of the job of handling this piece well balanced on keep it grounded. Want it all? Then this is the best pick for what can be offered in its range with a great mileage of 23.08 kmpl in the affordable bucks that your pockets does support.\u000a...READ MORE

VVolvo V40 D3 R-Design review\u000a  Volvo India has rolled out the hatchback series of its popular model V40 in the market. Brought into the country through the CBU (completely built-up units) route, this vehicle will compete against the likes of BMW 1 Series, Mercedes Benz A-Class and others in this segment. It is available in two variants, of which Volvo V40 D3 R-Design is the entry level variant. It looks almost the same as its Crossover version, but lacks scuff plates and body cladding. This trim is fitted with a 2.0-litre diesel engine under the hood, which comes with a displacement capacity of 1984cc. This powerplant is cleverly mated with a six speed automatic transmission gear box, which helps in generating a maximum power of 150bhp in combination with a peak torque output of 350Nm. The braking and suspension mechanism are quite proficient, which helps in keeping the vehicle stable at all times. Its braking mechanism is further augmented by ABS along with electronic brake force distribution. Apart from the reliable engine, it is fitted with a lot of comfort and safety features. It has a spacious internal cabin, which is incorporated with an automatic air conditioning unit, an advanced music system with various input options, parking assist system and many other such aspects. In addition to these, the car maker has blessed it with a lot of safety features, which protects the occupants as well as the vehicle. It is being offered with eighty airbags along with front passenger airbag cut off switch and side airbags, city safety tech, central locking system and so on.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VFiat Abarth Punto EVO 1.4 T-Jet review\u000a  Fiat Abarth Punto EVO 1.4 T-Jet is the only variant in this exclusive new model series. Essentially based on the existing Punto EVO hatchback, this car has been rendered by far more glamorous and captivating cosmetics to its exteriors. The most prominent among them are the fiery red decals, which dress the sides, the bonnet and the roof of the car. The name of the variant is also imprinted onto the decal areas, carving a unique flavor for this vehicle's image. The body colored bumpers make for a more harmonious vision, while the stylish wheel rims and rear spoiler escalate its sporty quality. The interior of the vehicle has been revised for a more racy aura that aligns with the outside look. The leather wrapped steering wheel and the fabric inserts give the place a more tidy appearance. This edition is graced with numerous comfort factors, from a desmodronic foldable key to an SMS readout facility. The front panel is wired with a trip meter, odomter, along with a trip calculator, eliminating a great amount of strain for the driver. The car's 1.4-litre T-Jet engine is the most powerful in its class and gives a platform for decent performance. The machine can zoom from stall to 100kmph in just 8.8 seconds, an astonishing figure for its class. The high speed capacities of the vehicle are guarded by strong safety elements, such as seatbelt reminders, height adjustable seatbelts and many others.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe low and streamlined build of the car exerts a look of true sportiness upon it. Stylish decals about its body further emphasis the vehicle's aggressive persona. By the front, the wide grille set up and the sleek headlamp clusters render an eye catching allure to this facet. The wide air intake section helps to dissipate heat from the engine. Fog lamps are present on either side of this, and they assist with the visibility function. The red racing stripe on the bonnet renews the machine's bold stature. By the side, the chrome plated door handles give the vehicle an aura of luxury. The 16 inch Scorpion alloy wheels and the red colored outside mirrors add to the exterior appeal. The stylish Abarth decals by the side and the roof give the vehicle its own exclusive persona. This effect is further stressed by the sporty rear spoiler, which helps to retain down-force when driving.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe cabin is moderately large, and the company has designed it for a rejuvenated drive environment. The seats are built on strong ergonomics, relieving stress and discomfort for occupants during the drive. Fine cloth is stitched onto them for an added element of comfort. Beside this, a fabric insert is present on the door trim and the door armrest. The all black soft touch front panel gives the cabin a more vitalized feel. The ambient lights on the dashboard improve utility and convenience, along with a boot lamp and a rear parcel shelf.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aPacked underneath is a mighty 1.4-litre T-Jet engine that is specially attended to serve the needs of high performance.

VMaruti Alto K10 LXI CNG Optional review\u000a  Maruti Alto K10 is one of the most successful cars from the stable of MSIL. The company has launched its facelifted version with petrol, and CNG fuel options for the buyers to choose from. Among those, the Maruti Alto K10 LXi CNG is the mid range variant. It is powered by a 1.0-litre petrol engine, which can displace 998cc and it is also accompanied by a CNG fuel kit. In the CNG mode it has the ability to churn out a maximum power of 58.2bhp in combination with 78Nm of peak torque output. At the same time, this motor allows the hatchback to generate about 32.26 Km/kg of decent mileage. This power plant is coupled with a five speed manual transmission gear box, which sends the engine power to its front wheels. The company has modified its exteriors with a new radiator grille, which has a single chrome slat, redesigned headlight cluster and bumper. On the other hand, it has a spacious internal cabin, which is bestowed with quite a few features like new dashboard with redesigned AC vents and 3-spoke steering wheel. Apart from these, the company has also given it a few protective aspects like seat belt for all passengers, rear doors with child safety locks and front ventilated disc brakes. It is being offered with a standard warranty of two years or 40000 Kilometers, whichever comes first.\u000a...READ MORE

Seatbelts secure the occupants, and for the front passengers this function is enhanced with the presence of pre-tensioners and belt force limiters. A reminder is also present for the driver's side seatbelt. An anti theft security system affirms the safety of the car, preventing unwanted entry.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1.

VMaruti Celerio Green VXI Optional review\u000a  Maruti Suzuki has applied all tactics on its Celerio hatchback to make it one of the best selling cars of our country. After uncurtaining this vehicle with both mill options, automated manual transmission system and additional safety features, the manufacturer has again added CNG trim to its lineup. Christened as Maruti Celerio Green VXI optional, this variant is packed with all standard features available in the running petrol VXI model, apart from including a new CNG fuel kit. The strategy behind making an appearance of this trim is to offer an enhanced mileage figure of 31.7 km/kg for the buyers. When CNG mode is activated it has a drastic impact on the power output, which decreases the power to around 9bhp and torque goes down to 12Nm when compared to the petrol model. Coil spring shock absorbers are affixed to the suspensions for added comfort. In this variant you also get dual front airbags for additional safety. Besides these, this runabout borrows exterior as well as interior design philosophy from its existing ones. Manual air conditioner, electric windows, central door locks and much more features have been added to offer a comfortable journey for its occupants. This compact hatchback is truly packed to lock horns with the likes of Ford Figo, Chevrolet Beat, Hyundai Grand i10 and Tata Zica, its biggest rivals in this segment.\u000a...READ MORE

VMaruti Alto K10 LX review\u000a  MSIL (Maruti Suzuki India Limited) is the largest car maker in the country, which has a lot of splendid vehicles in their stable. Among them, Maruti Alto K10 is a popular hatchback, whose facelifted version is launched with a few changes. It is introduced with a budget friendly price tag and it competes against the likes of Chevrolet Spark, Hyundai Santro Xing, Datsun Go and Hyundai Eon. It has several trim levels, of which, Maruti Alto K10 LX is the entry level variant. It is fitted with a 1.0-litre petrol engine, which can displace 998cc. This engine is mated with a five speed manual transmission gear box, which allows the hatchback to break the 60 kmph speed barrier in just 5.3 seconds. The braking and suspension mechanism of this model series is quite proficient. Its exteriors are modified with redesigned radiator grille, headlight cluster and bumper, which makes it more attractive. Apart from these, the interiors also get some changes like revamped dashboard with rectangular AC vents, 3-spoke steering wheel and a new instrument panel. On the whole, it is a perfect vehicle with standard comfort features, good engine performance and reasonable price range. It is being offered with a standard warranty of two years or 40000 Kilometers, whichever comes first. At the same time, the buyers can also avail an extended warranty of one year or 60000 Kilometers at an additional cost paid to authorized dealers.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VMaruti Alto K10 LXI Optional review\u000a  India's homegrown car manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki India Limited has produced a wide range of vehicles in the automobile market. Maruti Alto K10 is one of its best selling hatchbacks, whose facelifted version is introduced in a few trim levels. Among these, Maruti Alto K10 LXI is a mid range variant that receives some modifications to its interiors as well as exteriors, while the technical specifications remain the same. It is incorporated with the same 1.0-litre petrol engine that produces 67.04bhp in combination with torque output of 90Nm. But, it can now produce a maximum fuel economy of 24.07 Kmpl, which is rather good. It has a stylish body design, which looks quite refreshing. The front fascia has a redesigned radiator grille that has a chrome plated strip. It also has a revamped bumper and a tweaked headlight cluster. This hatch is blessed with a roomy cabin that includes a three spoke power steering wheel, rectangular central AC vents and a new instrument cluster. Other standard features like sun visors, air conditioning unit and a few other comfort aspects are available. The suspension system is quite proficient, which helps it to maintain its stability at all times. This trim is loaded with some standard protective features that offers security to its occupants and the vehicle as well. It is currently offered in six attractive color options, which are Tango Orange, Cerulean Blue, Granite Grey, Superior White, Silky Silver and Fire Brick Red for the customers to select from. It has standard warranty of 24 months or 40,000 kilometers, whichever comes first. This period can be further extended to two years or 40,000 kilometers, whichever is earlier.\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VFord Figo 1.5D Ambiente MT review\u000a  After almost five years of its presence in India, Figo hatchback has undergone a major overhaul. Whether it is regarding the styling or features or its technical specifications, everything about this vehicle has been refreshed including its variant nomenclature. The trim next-in-line to the base diesel version is now classified as Ford Figo 1.5D Ambiente MT . Also, it is now powered by a 1.5-litre turbocharged oil-burner, which currently lies under Figo Aspire. Capable of returning a mileage of 26 Kmpl, this new hatchback has came out of nowhere to become a strong competitor in its segment. Its styling is another factor that can really change its fortunes, since it gets everything that are needed to grab your attention. Its Aston Martin inspired trapezoidal grille and bold headlight cluster makes a powerful statement on roads. The cabin too has received a new design, which looks identical to that of its sedan sibling. Moving on to the comfort section, this variant isn't the one with full-fledged feature, but has all the essentials like power assisted steering, electrical windows and a manual air conditioning unit. Its safety department is also packed with crucial factors like ABS with EBD, seatbelts and immobilizer, which indeed makes it an ideal model to choose.\u000a...READ MORE

VMaruti Baleno 1.2 Zeta review\u000a  Maruti Baleno 1.2 Zeta , the mid-range version is geared up to take on the likes of the Hyundai Elite i20, Honda Jazz, Volkswagen Polo and Fiat Punto Evo. This trim has a huge package of features, which include antilock braking system, electronic brake force distribution, driver seat belt reminder and dual front airbags. The passenger comfort is also taken care of with the likes of automatic air conditioning, central locking, front and rear seat adjustable headrests. Looks wise, it is stunning from inside as well as outside with aspects, such as alloy wheels, chrome finished door handles and a sleek front grille. However, its interior has metal inserted front footwell illumination, door handles and a parking brake lever. This model gets an impressive braking mechanism along disc and drum brakes affixed to its front and rear wheels, respectively.

VMaruti Celerio LXI AT review\u000a  Maruti Suzuki India Limited, the leader of the Indian automobile market has rolled out another low cost hatchback in the market. It is none other than the most anticipated small hatchback, Maruti Celerio, which is being offered with a 1.0-litre petrol engine. This new hatch comes in many trim levels among which, Maruti Celerio LXi AT is one of the entry level trims. Whats new about this latest hatch is its automated manual transmission gearbox, which is a new transmission system from the company, which thereby makes it easy to drive the vehicle in heavy traffic conditions. This auto gear shift system is nothing but a manual transmission system, which doesn't require a clutch for shifting of gears. At the same time, it will not effect the fuel efficiency or performance of the engine. The manufacturer claims that this small car powered by the K-Series engine can deliver a peak mileage of 23.1 Kmpl, which is rather impressive. This base variant is being offered with pretty basic features such as AC unit, power steering system, outside mirrors and so on. However, this trim comes with some of the important safety features such as immobilizer system, high mount stop lamps and so on.\u000a...READ MORE

VHyundai EON Era Plus review\u000a  This variant, Hyundai Eon Era Plus is one of the mid level trim in its lineup. Its safety section has been cut down by removing the central locking system, which is a setback. Apart from this, everything else is retained and no additions are made. It incorporates a 0.8-litre, iRDE petrol engine that is based on a SOHC (single overhead cam shaft) and contains 3-cylinders and 9 valves. It has a displacement of 814cc and a power of 55.23bhp along with a torque of 74.53Nm. Mated with a 5-speed manual transmission, this vehicle can be relied for adept performance. Its outer body looks good with chrome application on the front, unique set of tail and head lamps, a trendy spoiler along with other detailing such as body toned bumpers. Inside the compartment, apart from the many storage units like cup and bottle holders, even the pedal space and dashboard have received an exclusive design. Its interior scheme has a two tone scheme, while it also has bucket type seats, which make the cabin appear decent and cozy. For the sake of handling this vehicle efficiently, there are robust tyres as well as disc brakes along with an electric assisted power steering. Safety system has been designed by making a strong foundation of immunity to the very structure itself with reinforcements. It is further addressed by equipping passive as well as active protective features such as seatbelts to front and rear seats, child safety locks to the rear doors and an engine immobilizer too. Aspects such as an air conditioner unit, power windows along with full sized armrests to the front doors and a power outlet for charging gadgets are provided for convenience. Instrument panel is imbibed by notifications of low fuel warning, dual trip meter, gear shift indicator and graphic band fuel gauge. Remote release to fuel lid and tail gate make their way in keeping the driver's job easy. All in all, even after losing a key feature, this trim still stands appealing to choose.\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VFord Figo 1.2P Titanium MT review\u000a  Right now, it is the Ford Figo hatchback that is the center of attraction in the car market. This is their second generation version, which shares most of its design cues and features with its compact sedan sibling, Aspire. Out of the several variants, this Ford Figo 1.2P Titanium MT falls in the mid range. It comes with a roomy cabin that gives the feel of a home, once stepped inside it. A special mention to the cockpit, which is well designed and looks quite modernistic with equipments like the MFD screen, tilt adjustable steering wheel and automatic HVAC unit. The seat height adjustment facility for driver and foldable function for the rear one, both are major advantages. On the other hand, it has dynamic exteriors that blends style as well as sportiness. The chrome plated front radiator grille and a trendy headlight cluster are sure shot the head turners. The modish set of alloy wheels become the main highlight in its side profile, whereas its rear end includes an expressive boot lid and a wide windshield. This trim does not lag behind when it comes to safety. It includes door ajar warning, front airbags, perimeter alarm, keyless entry and a few others. What powers this machine is a 1196cc Ti-VCT motor that can return 18.16 Kmpl mileage. This comes mated with a five speed manual transmission gear box. It delivers superior power and has reduced emissions.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis latest entrant has got an aerodynamic structure and an edgy design. The rear is curvy and this particular profile is emphasized by the well designed boot lid. The tail lamps on either sides come along with turn indicators. The bumper too, looks different from others, whereas the windscreen includes a defogger. On the sides, both the window sill and B-pillars are offered in black, while the handles and outside rear view mirrors are painted in body color. The ORVMs are further integrated with side turn indicators. Meanwhile, the 14 inch alloy wheels bring a complete fresh look to its sides. Above all, the chrome treated radiator grille remains the most captivating element, which is in trapezoidal shape. Even its four horizontal bars get the same glossy coating. The sleek headlight cluster with chrome bezel is also impressive. The bumper then includes fog lamps and variable intermittent wipers are equipped to its windshield. All in all, this hatch is undoubtedly a treat to the eyes.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIts interiors are quite exceptional with fine quality materials, attractive charcoal black color scheme and the top class design. However, the lunar grey color to door handles, audio bezel and steering wheel, gives a way more classy appeal. All its door panels have fabric accentuation and these further include storage space for cups and bottles. The seats are offered with fabric covers, and have adjustable headrests at front. Meanwhile, the full width back seat comes with folding facility, which aids for storing more luggage inside. The steering wheel on its dashboard is mounted with phone and audio controls for added convenience. The notifications on instrument cluster include water temperature warning, maintenance, distance to empty, low fuel as well as gear shift indicator. The map pockets for front seats, chrome parking brake lever tip, 12V accessory socket, rear parcel tray, boot lamp, and grab handles with coat hooks are a few more components present in the cabin.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis five seater is powered by a 1.2-litre, petrol motor that ensures minimal emissions. It is a four cylinder, Ti-VCT engine that is based on a double overhead camshaft valve configuration. Having been paired with a five speed manual transmission gear box, it transmits power to its front wheels.

VTata Nano XTA review\u000a  The Tata Group is an automobile manufacturer which is renowned in the Indian market and is known for its continuous innovation. As a part of these efforts, their Nano series stand as a true example of this company's endeavor for offering the best of convenience in the most affordable price. This particular variant, the Tata Nano XTA , is the top end trim, which is furnished with all the necessary features for a hatchback and many more. The look of this small car is altered to a great extent to make it more appealing. The smile shaped front grille and rear air dam adds to the styling and body colored bumpers, external mirrors and door handles help in giving a uniformity and therefore resulting in a decent appearance. Inside the compartment there are features like an Amphistream music system with four speakers, an air-conditioning unit with heater, sliding and folding enabled seats. Though the power emission is minimal, this small car has counterbalance functions such as booster assisted brakes and electronic power steering, which will help the driver in the overall handling. For having been integrated with an automatic transmission, this car can deliver an impressive mileage of 21.9 Kmph. There is enough space in the cabin for storage which comprise of two glove boxes, cup holders and magazine pockets. Apart from these, this series is now offered with an extra luggage compartment at the rear end too. This increases the storage capacity of this small car to a good enough amount. Security aspect too is well furbished for having body reinforcements, seatbelts and central locking system. With all such exciting changes, this trim has a definite advantage over many other offerings in its segment.\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VHyundai Grand i10 Sportz review\u000a  Hyundai Grand i10 Sportz is the mid range petrol variant in its model lineup and it has been blessed with 1.2-litre, Kappa Dual, VTVT based petrol mill under its hood. This mid range trim has been equipped with most of the features that are actually offered to the top end model in this segment. The company claims that this new hatchback variant comes with a very special body design and structure by using anti-corrosive steel and ring structure application that contributes for the enhancement of rigidity and robustness of the body. On the other hand, the company has designed this 1.2-litre, DOHC based Kappa petrol mill using VTVT technology that offers the best of both \u2013 mileage and optimum performance as well. Its advanced engine technology controls the mechanism of valves depending upon the engine requirement, which eventually improves the efficiency with lower emissions. The company has also focused on the comfort and utility features of this hatchback, which will ensure lavishness on the move. At the same time, the interior cabin gets a dual tone beige and black color look with blue illumination inside. Launched at a very attractive price, Hyundai Grand i10 is going to help the company to witness a new high in its sales. This hatch has been placed in the affordable hatchback segment where it will lock horns with Toyota Etios, Renault Pulse, Maruti Ritz, Chevrolet Sail UVA and other such vehicles.\u000a...READ MORE

VMaruti Celerio VXI AT Optional review\u000a  Maruti Suzuki India Limited has officially introduced a new member in its portfolio christened as Celerio. This latest model is available in various trim levels among which Maruti Celerio VXi AT comes as the mid level variant. This trim is assembled with a 1.0-litre, 3-cylinder, K10B engine that is coupled with a 5-speed auto gear shift box. This is just another type of manual gearbox that doesn't require the use of a clutch, thereby makes it easy for the driver, while maneuvering in heavy traffic conditions with zero possibility of car stopping. According to the company, this latest hatch can produce an attractive mileage figure of about 23.1 Kmpl, which is an added advantage of this vehicle. On the other hand, this particular variant comes with rather basic features such as a manual AC unit with heater, a responsive power steering, fabric upholstered seats, a large glove box unit along with other storage spaces and so on. However, the company blessed this trim with some significant safety features including an engine immobilizer unit, a central locking system, high mount stop lamp and quite a few others.\u000a...READ MORE

VTata Nano XE review\u000a  Tata Nano XE is the entry level variant in its model lineup. This latest version looks quite attractive in its new infinity design theme. It now includes a perforated radiator grille at front, which resembles a smiley face. In the rear, it features an expressive boot lid, while on its sides, the black colored B-pillars as well as door mirrors makes it look quite appealing. This hatchback has its interiors decorated with a complete black color scheme. It is although a small car, but the space inside it, is good enough to offer better convenience to its passengers. Some of the key aspects in the cabin include three spoke steering wheel, digital clock, rear foldable seat, dual glove boxes and driver information display that adds to the comfort level. On the other hand, it has the advanced structural stability that aids in improving overall drive safety. Moreover, the intrusion beams equipped to its side doors as well as central high mount stop lamp also assists in bringing enhanced protection to its occupants. This facelifted version retains the same engine specifications, which is, the 0.6-litre petrol engine that churns out 37.5bhp power and 51Nm torque output.

At the bottom, the wide air intake section files as a boost to the look, while at the same time, helping to keep the engine cool. The wide bonnet is graced with slender lines, giving a more attractive effect. The sloping back windshield blends with the car's streamlined profile, and it decreases air resistance when driving. Coming to the side profile, the slender shape of hatchback adds a marvelous touch to its image. There are black colored door handles, and the driver's side mirror is also black, making for a matching look. A sweeping body line at the bottom gives a more energetic feel.

VMercedes-Benz A-Class A180 Sport review\u000a  Mercedes-Benz A-Class A 180 Sport is one of the two variants in this well-famed model series. The vehicle is revised with minor updates to improve the overall driving experience. Starting with the tech specs, it is powered by the same 1.6-litre turbocharged engine, which takes the vehicle to a top speed of 202kmph. Its prowess on the road is guarded with a range of important safety features. Techno aids prevent loss of control, ranging from the ABS, the ESP, the ASC, while an electromechanical power steering system imparts aid to the driver in case of critical drive scenarios. Also present is a tyre pressure warning system, a seat occupancy sensor for the front passenger, a central locking system and an automatic locking facility for the doors. The insides include a 3-spoke design steering wheel comes along with 12 function buttons and a gear shift lever in leather. All of this is further strengthened with the addition of numerous comfort facilities. A 11.4 cms color display is integrated into the instrument cluster for a more lavished cabin environment. A trip computer is present for the benefit of the driver, along with a current consumption indicator and an outside temperature display. Other notable features include an illuminated glove compartment, electrical adjustment and memory facility for the driver's seat. Bluetooth interface provides a central hub for hands-free calling and audio streaming within the cabin. Going along with this is a color display with a 14.7cms screen, a speed sensitive volume control and a central infotainment controller on the central console.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe vehicle has a greatly appealing persona which blends rich design themes with a modern and sporty sculpture. With its low, streamlined shape and balanced outer proportion, it evokes the impression of a genuine sports car. The swept back windscreen gives it a sound aerodynamic quality to go along with the drive. Posted at the front is a bold radiator grille with two louvres in the vehicle color. Embellished upon this is a high quality chrome trim, which exerts an effect of radiance and beauty over the vehicle. Adorned at the top of the grille is the star emblem of the brand, making a more distinctive mark upon the overall look. The headlamp clusters on either side come along with Bi-Xenon lights, and a cleaning system is also present for the best functioning capacity. Present for this car are 5-twin-spoke light alloy wheels painted matt black, and with a high sheen finish. The side profile is given its true grandeur with the sweeping body lines, which add to the prominence of the car's image. There are electrically foldable mirrors for a more eased out functioning, and the aspherically curved mirror glass adds to the unique look. At the rear, the new design of the lights gives the car a more refreshed taste, and there are fog lamps that improve the safety when driving.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe cabin is quiet spacious, and it has been done up for a rich and sophisticated image. The well designed ergonomic seats come along with Artico upholstery, adding to the quality of the occupants' drive. The door center panels come in Messancy for a more exclusive aura. At the front, the instrument cluster comes along with a multi-function color display. For the benefit of the driver, there is a 3-spoke multi-function steering wheel which comes with 12 function keys. The wheel and the shift lever are wrapped in Nappa leather, adding a more plush dimensions to the driver's experience.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aWithin this car is a 1.6-litre petrol engine which displaces 1595cc. It consists of an in-line 4-cylinder configuration, and is further improved with a variable valve timing feature. A turbocharger has been built onto the plant, boosting its performance. The power-train generates a torque of 200Nm at 1250rpm to 4000rpm, coupled with a power of 122bhp at 5000rpm. The working of the engine is further enhanced with a seven speed dual clutch transmission, which ensures a strain-free functioning for the driver. Aside from this, a direct fuel injection system brings smoother fuel transmission and minimal hassle in the process.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe front arm of its chassis has been rigged with a McPherson strut, while for the rear, there is a completely re-designed four-link axle.

VFord Figo 1.5D Trend MT review\u000a  Astounding looks, excellent engine performance and class leading features are what defines the new Figo hatchback. The Ford Figo 1.5D Trend MT is one among its several variants. On the outside, it has some visible character lines all over that add to its style. The front fascia has large headlamps surrounding its radiator grille, which has a chrome surround. Also, there are a pair of round shaped fog lamps fitted to its bumper. The side profile has a conventional set of 14 inch steel wheels, while side turn indicators are equipped to its ORVMs. Meanwhile, the rear end too looks sporty with an expressive tail gate with variant badging and a wide windscreen with high mount stop lamp. It is 3886mm long and has wheelbase of 2491mm. The width and height measures around 1695mm and 1525mm respectively. Passenger security is best ensured as it is loaded with significant features like immobilizer, three point seat belts, and airbags for front passengers. On the other hand, its spacious cabin houses well cushioned seats of which, the rear one is foldable. Besides these, the map pockets, vanity mirrors, infotainment system, power windows and a few others are useful for providing enhanced comfort. This trim is brought in with a 1.5-litre TDCi oil burner that is powerful and makes 99bhp. Not just this, but by returning a healthy mileage of approximately 25.83 Kmpl, it also becomes highly fuel efficient and one of the finest in its segment. On the whole, a fantastic model which is most likely to be a bigger success than its predecessor.\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VHyundai i10 Sportz 1.1L LPG review\u000a  Hyundai i10 is one of the best-selling hatchbacks in the Indian automobile market. This is an economical small car that comes in several trim levels with petrol engine as standard along with an LPG fuel kit as option. The Hyundai i10 Sportz 1.1L LPG is the top end variant powered by a 1086cc IRDE2 petrol engine that is further mated with an LPG fuel kit.

It is available in a few trims among which, Chevrolet Sail 1.2 LT ABS is a top end petrol variant. This vehicle is presently offered in six exciting body paint options for the customers to choose from. These include Linen Beige, Caviar Black, Summit White, Sandrift Grey, Switch Blade Silver and Super Red metallic finish as well. It has an eye catching outer appearance and includes some new aspects like chrome highlighted fog lamps, hawk wing style headlamps and a set of 6-spoke, 14 inch alloy wheels. The interiors look appealing in a dual tone color scheme. The stylish instrument cluster has icy blue illumination, while the steering wheel gets leather wrapping. Other new features in this trim include back-lit power window switches and luxurious leatherette upholstery for well cushioned seats. It is powered by a 1.2-litre SMARTECH petrol engine that can generate a power of 82.4bhp along wit torque output of 108.5Nm.

This vehicle is available in petrol as well as diesel engine options. Talking about its Nissan Micra Diesel XL trim, it has good looking exteriors, including small grille, stunning headlights and body colored door handles. This model has a minimum turning radius of 4.65 meters, wheelbase of 2450mm and ground clearance of 150mm. Inside, it also gets a enticed environment with Greige theme, sporty dashboard and good quality of upholstery. The manufacturer bestows a comfortable journey for its occupants with air conditioner, heater, tachometer and remote keyless entry. This model provides truly impressive safety while traveling with driver airbags, speed sensing automatic door locking facility and dual horn. Mechanically, it includes a 1462cc diesel engine under its hood along with a total of four cylinders and makes torque of 160Nm. This mill comes with a turbocharger and can be compressed in the ratio of 17:9:1. This hatchback competes against the likes of the Chevrolet Beat, Maruti Swift, Volkswagen Polo, Fiat Punto and Ford Figo. The company offers 2 years or 50000 Kilometers (time or distance, whichever comes earlier) basic warranty on this runabout.

VMaruti Celerio LXI AT Optional review\u000a  Maruti Celerio LXI AT Optional is a mid range variant in this newly launched model series. It comes with very minimal revisions to its safety features. A highlight of this new car is the ABS system, which ingrains stability into the drive. Safety is also ordained with a driver's seatbelt warning, a key off/on reminder and a headlamp on reminder. The slender body lines by the side accentuate the sporty character of the vehicle, along with the neat window frames. The car is offered in a range of attractive colour schemes, ranging from blazing red and cerulean blue to silky silver. This makes for a more personalised touch for the benefit of the customers. The interior design exudes an aura of style and comfort. A ticket holder is present by the sunvisor, and 3 position cabin lighting ensures that gloomy times do not hamper the joy of the drive. An information display integrated cluster instrument cluster adds to the sophisticated feel of the interior. Wired into this are fuel consumption readings and a 12V power socket, which enables charging within the car. Coming to the raw side of the vehicle, it is armed with a K10B engine, which makes for strong speed characteristics. It delivers a mileage of 23.1kmpl, which is a mark among vehicles of its class.\u000a...READ MORE

VMaruti Alto K10 VXI Option review\u000a  This Maruti Alto K10 VXI Option is a high end variant in its model lineup. Its facelifted version is introduced in the car market, where its exteriors receive major updates. The headlight cluster is slightly tweaked, while there is a chrome strip on the radiator grille. The front and rear bumpers are revamped and the bright tail light cluster is redesigned. Whereas, its side profile sports stylish external wing mirrors that makes it look eye catching. On the other hand, its interiors too are modified to give it a complete new look. The cabin is decorated in a dual tone color scheme and includes a new instrument cluster, three spoke steering wheel and rectangular shaped central air vents. The elegantly designed dashboard as well as door trims are in two tone color scheme, which further gives a refreshing look to its interiors. This vehicle is powered by a 1.0-litre petrol engine that can generate a peak power of 67.04bhp in combination with a maximum torque output of 90Nm, which is rather good. This mill is mated with a five speed manual transmission gear box. There are many safety aspects available in this trim like child safety locks, key-off reminder, driver airbag and many others, which adds to the safety quotient. It will compete with Datsun Go, Hyundai Eon, Hyundai Santro Xing, Chevrolet Spark and a few others in this segment. It is offered with a standard warranty of 24 months or 40,000 kilometers and this period can be further increased to 2-years or 40,000 kilometers, whichever comes first.\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VTata Nano CNG XM review\u000a  This celebrated passenger car manufacturer,Tata Motors, which is well known for its innovative automobiles, was especially appreciated for the launch of their Nano series. Ever since its inception, this model has been undergoing many developments and has been surprising the markets with every appearance. It is available in petrol and CNG versions and this variant, Tata Nano CNG XM falls under the latter offering. The concept of this small car is to have all the necessary features that a car can offer at a minimal affordable price in the Indian markets. This vision has been served quite well by packing 80-litres of cargo volume along with a spacious cabin with quite an amount of comfort features. The external image is decorated well with fashionable front grille in smiley shape, petal shaped headlamps and a trendy airdam at the rear. The mileage of this variant is one of the major advantages in picking this trim out of all other offerings in this segment. It has a fuel economy of about 36 Km/Kg. The comfort features such as adjustable seats, headrests, air conditioner unit and storage space like cup holders, map pockets and glove box will make the cabin a convenient place to drive. This offering which is available with quite a reasonable price tag has a convincing amount of safety too incorporated within it. The body reinforcements, seatbelts, child locks and advanced braking mechanism will make this hatchback a reliable small car to go for. The company has offered it a warranty of four years or 60000 Kilometers, whichever is earlier.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VMaruti Baleno 1.2 Delta review\u000a  Maruti Baleno 1.2 Delta is rolled out with admirable features and gorgeous outlook. From the visual perspective, this car is quite good along a lot of enticing cosmetics, such as chrome finished front grille that has Suzuki's emblem at the center, body colored bumpers as well as door handles. It has an overall ground clearance of 170mm, fuel tank capacity of 37-litres and minimum turning radius of 4.9 meters. This trim is quite decent in terms of its overall weight (kerb), which is in the range of 865 to 890 Kgs depending on the variant selected. Inside the cabin, this model is designed amazingly with fabric seat upholstery, metal tipped parking brake and much more. Apart from stylish furnishings, other amenities include remote keyless entry, central locking, front and rear power windows. Safety features comprise of reverse parking sensor, a pair of front airbags and driver seat belt reminder. On the other hand, it includes a 1.2-litre petrol engine with DOHC valve configuration that can displace 1197cc. This powertrain has a capacity of making a peak torque of 115Nm. As all the other vehicles from this company, this hatchback also has a standard warranty that can also be extended further for another year or so at an additional cost.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a...READ MORE

VRenault KWID RXT review\u000a  Renault KWID RXT is the top-end variant in this newly launched hatchback series. This most awaited model has surprised everyone with its impressive price tag. While providing all basic essentials of a small car and also incorporating additional features that are not usually seen in this sector. The first-in-segment features bestowed in it are the infotainment system with a user-friendly 18 inch touchscreen. Also a sporty all-new digital cluster imbibing multiple notifications and many more add-ons are in this hatch. A 2-DIN stereo unit also features Bluetooth audio streaming and handsfree connectivity. This baby car has looks of a utility vehicle and capability to entice customers, who would want to avail an SUV in the price range of a hatchback. The reasons that make it look like a UV is that, it is embossed with a massive frontage that includes a newly designed wide grille. Its appearance looks bigger from all sides as its height seems to be increased by tweaking its suspension. But even then, as it is built on their CMF-A based platform, it manages to stay light in order to contribute to the performance with its power to weight ratio. Though this new addition imports most of its looks from its elder sibling, Duster, it still is successful in showcasing its identity with a little uniqueness. We can see body colored bumpers(both front and rear), an edgy bonnet and boot lid along with sharp lines on the side profile. These convey its message of strength and magnanimity. Safety must always go side by side with sturdyness and this is also addressed well. It is decked with a strong suspension mechanism, a pair of disc brakes to front wheels and instrument cluster having warnings and notifications. It has a promising mileage of 25.17 Kmpl, when driven under standard driving conditions and a gear shift indicator (GSI) will enable to attain optimum fuel efficiency. Another class-leading facet is its 300 litre trunk that can be stretched to about 1115 litres by adjusting the rear bench seat. Buyers can avail a warranty of 2 years or 50,000 Kms (whichever is earlier). Renault also has numerous service stations all over the country and also offers a free roadside assistance for 2 years.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe frontage has a masculine grille that is bold as well as rugged looking. A set of C-shaped signature headlamps are fitted on either sides of it. Just below this, there is a broad air dam that is flanked by a pair of round shaped fog lamps. Both its bumpers are painted in body shade to make them look uniform. Over the sides, the wheel arches have cladding and the innovative aspect here is that it also has side indicators mounted over them. External wing mirrors are fitted on both sides and painted in body color. The B-pillars as well as the body side molding are in black color as well. On the rear, a spoiler is integrated to offer sportiness to this hatchback. As an overall enhancement, multi-spoke wheel covers are decorated to the sturdy set of 13 inch steel wheels.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIts cabin is designed with a two tone dashboard as the foremost attractive characteristic. A digital instrument cluster is incorporated that has chrome finishing. Its responsive power steering wheel has piano black accents, which further has leather inserts as well. The piano black color features even on the center fascia with chrome decoration. This chrome can be seen even on the AC vents that are adjustable and closable. While the floor console has two cup holders along with other storage spaces in the compartment. It also holds a parking brake within. The front contoured seats and premium seats with integrated headrests have inner and outer valance cover. At the same time, foldable backrests and integrated neck rests are provided for the rear seats. All these seats are wrapped in champion red fabric upholstery.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis variant features a 0.8-litre petrol engine, which is capable to displace about 799cc. It carries 3 cylinders and 12 valves. This motor can pump out a maximum power of 53.26bhp at 5678rpm and a peak torque output of 72Nm at 4386rpm. It is mated with a 5-speed manual synchromesh based gear box.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aIts chassis holds a superior combination of braking and suspension that greatly contributes to its performance. The front axle is fitted with McPherson strut with a lower traverse link. While the rear ones have a twist beam suspension with coil springs. When it comes to braking, the front wheels are coupled with efficient disc brakes, whereas the rear wheels have the conventional strong and standard set of drum brakes. The electric power steering will help the driver in handling this small car much efficiently.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe features that make way for alleviating the driver\u2019s effort are the respondent power steering and tailgate plus fuel lid inner release. Then there are power windows integrated to the front doors. Along with the air-conditioning unit, there is also a heater for regulating the cabin\u2019s temperature as per preference. This unit is further complimented by vents that includes a 4-speed blower and also a 5-position air distribution facility too. An on-board trip computer is available in the instrument panel. Apart from the upper and lower glove boxes that are embedded into the dashboard, there is an open storage in front of the passenger seat. Moreover, the door trims carry map storage and a 1-litre bottle holding capacity. The rear parcel tray adds to the utility value of keeping a few things at hand. There is a cabin light with automatic on/off function. The front seats have reclining and longitudinal adjustment feature to them. Other factors that are present include, assist grips for rear passengers, a sunvisor on the co-driver side, gear shift indicator.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis section is well packed for immunity against all the possible threats. A remote keyless entry with central locking will give convenience along with safety. An immobilizer will freeze the engine in case it recognizes any unauthorized access into the vehicle. An intermittent front wiper and auto wiping feature will keep the vision clear under rainy condition. The high-mounted stop lamp will enable the vehicles behind in the darker hours to recognize this vehicle's presence.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Bluetooth connectivity is a major advantage.\u000a\u000a2. Price tag is quite impressive.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a1. Absence of airbag even for the driver.\u000a\u000a2. Several other safety aspects can be offered.\u000a...READ MORE

VTata Indica eV2 eLS review\u000a  Among the unending list of automobile manufacturers functioning directly or indirectly in India, the customers, at least the middle class ones, tend to choose domestic manufacturers over the International makers. It may be due to the assured support, the local players bring in their vehicles or the intentions they manufacture their vehicles with. The Indian companies claim to know what the customer wants, at least they may know better than an imported model. But the real test comes when the same local players compete with each other. Among such competitions, few automobile manufacturers sustain a long term foot print and certainly make their presence felt in a definite manner. They need not worry about certain models at least for a period of time. Tata motors is one such manufacturer and Tata Indica eV2 is definitely one such model. Though the model was launched amidst some speculation, it sure achieved a cult status among people desiring a fuel efficient, slightly robust model. It defined fuel efficient hatchbacks of India. With its diesel engines, the vehicles were offered at an affordable price leaving no doubt in purchasing them. Tata also managed to create a beauty out of them, which though might seem uncanny at first, somehow grows on the customers to a level that other hatchbacks no longer seem to hit the same mark. Tata India eV2 comes in different models with differing mileage, additional features and certainly varying prices. But the interesting part about a Tata vehicle is, it does the part. It might go over its line in offering more than promised but it most certainly never gets below its promises. Among the entire range the is a mid range vehicle in terms of price and comes at a decent price of Rs. 4.13 lakhs (ex-showroom). Powered with a 1.4-litre common rail CR4 engine, the car manages to offer a pleasant mileage that is suitable not just for the city rides but also for the long highway rides. The mileage of the vehicle is truly exceptional at 21.3 Kmpl in the city and 25 Kmpl on the highways. The success this model might enjoy is too much to boast about. Considering the heritage of Tata Motors and Tata Indica in particular, this variant is destined to enjoy a pleasant run on the Indian roads.\u000a...READ MORE

Maruti Alto K10 is one of its best selling hatchbacks, whose facelifted version is introduced in a few trim levels. Among these, Maruti Alto K10 LXI is a mid range variant that receives some modifications to its interiors as well as exteriors, while the technical specifications remain the same. It is incorporated with the same 1.0-litre petrol engine that produces 67.04bhp in combination with torque output of 90Nm. But, it can now produce a maximum fuel economy of 24.07 Kmpl, which is rather good. It has a stylish body design, which looks quite refreshing.

This hatch is blessed with a roomy cabin that includes a three spoke power steering wheel, rectangular central AC vents and a new instrument cluster. Other standard features like sun visors, air conditioning unit and a few other comfort aspects are available. The suspension system is quite proficient, which helps it to maintain its stability at all times. This trim is loaded with some standard protective features that offers security to its occupants and the vehicle as well. It is currently offered in six attractive color options, which are Tango Orange, Cerulean Blue, Granite Grey, Superior White, Silky Silver and Fire Brick Red for the customers to select from.

VFord Figo 1.2P Ambiente MT review\u000a  Ford India is advancing its position in the nation's car market with the release of the new Figo model. This is a vehicle belonging to the hatchback segment, and it has been released following a stir up of anticipation. Among the variants that the model is available in, one is the Ford Figo 1.2P Ambient MT . This is a mid range trim, and it comes with a mediocre grade of features to dress its interior and exterior cosmetics. Starting with the heavier aspects, it is run by a 1.2-litre petrol engine, which makes for good performance as well as decent fuel savings. The car is also rooted in firm safety, with the aid of numerous features such as airbags, seatbelts, headlamp leveling and headrests to keep the occupants safe and at peace. The car's interior is conditioned for an aura of luxury and peace. The seats come with adjustable functions, and a host of utilities for added comfort. Many storage arenas are present, giving occupants the freedom of storing items without tumult. A 12V power socket allows the charging of devices within the cabin. The atmosphere within the car is lavished with the help of fine seat upholstery and with an attractive color scheme.
