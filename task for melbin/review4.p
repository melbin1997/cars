S"Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class is yet another sophisticated product from the German automobile firm that reinvented the perception of an urban SUV. It is a pure SUV with design elements of a sedan that makes it a unique contender in its league. Initially, the firm introduced this SUV series in just one trim and in later stages, its AMG version was put on offer for the Indian customers. The automobile firm classifies this luxury vehicle as a compact SUV, but its overall length measures more than 4.4-meters earning its rightful position among mid size luxury vehicles. It is currently available in three variants with one petrol and diesel engine option for the buyers to choose from. Its petrol motor is a 2.0-litre turbocharged power plant and the oil-burner is a 2.2-litre motor that is paired to a 7-speed 7G-DCT automatic transmission gearbox. This vehicle looks stunning from the insides and it resembles the silhouette of the A-Class hatchback. On the other hand, buyers have a choice to personalize the interiors with either all-beige or all-black color scheme. As for its exterior styling, this vehicle has compact structure adorned with several trademark features like bi-xenon headlamps, along with LED DRLs and a sturdy set of 18-inch alloy wheels. However, the main attraction of its appearance is its chrome plated grille that is embodied with the iconic company's insignia. This SUV is fitted with an array of comfort features including electrically adjustable front seats with memory function for driver's seat. Also, there is an auto air conditioning unit and an advanced parking assistance. To add to the customer excitement, the manufacturer is offering panoramic sliding sunroof as a standard feature for all the variants.

Currently positioned in the entry level luxury SUV segment, it is rivaling against the likes of Audi Q3 and BMW X1 in India. It is currently available on offer with an unbeatable warranty of 3-years without any restrictions to its kilometers.This SUV from Mercedes Benz has a typical body structure unlike an SUV, and it stands with a total height of just 1494mm. This adorns it a look that no other SUV has it in their respective segment. Its front facade does like classy, but the sporty cosmetics renders it an intimidating look. The radiator grille up front has horizontally positioned louvres and are embedded with the company's logo. The headlight cluster has a black tinted design and is housed with xenon headlamps along with signature LED DRLs and turn indicators. Below this, it has a dual tone bumper featuring a pair of large air ducts and an air dam, which offers better ventilation to the engine. When viewed from the side facade, this vehicle looks much alike a crossover owing to its low and masculine stance. The primary reason for its sophistication is because of the so called 'dropping-line' that extends from its headlamps to the rear fenders. The flared up wheel fenders are accompanied with a set of alloy wheels that further adds to its dynamic stance. There are several other stying features given to this vehicle including aluminum ski racks, body colored door handles and glossy window frames. As for the rear, this SUV has a perfect look with larger taillight cluster and rugged bumper. As we can see, its bumper has a dual tone scheme owing to the black colored protective cladding. The windscreen is also accompanied by a spoiler featuring an integrated LED third brake light along with a wiper as well. The overall look of this vehicle is emphasized by the prominent company's star, which is embedded on to the tailgate.Exterior Measurements:The manufacturer has built this four wheeler with an overall length measuring 4417mm along with a decent height of just 1494mm. Its minimum ground clearance is 183mm, which is somewhat equivalent to a conventional sedan. This vehicle has a decent width of 1804mm (excluding ORVMs) and a wheelbase of 2699mm, which is quite long.Ed's take: The GL-Class always had spacious interiors, however the styling was basic. Mercedes-Benz has taken care of this aspect in the new one and now the design is contemporary and we will like interiors of this SUV. From the outside, it looks like a compact vehicle, but step inside, the cabin design will tell you a different tale with its huge space. With this SUV, customers will get an option to customized its interiors with three different color schemes. Furthermore, they can be highlighted by either metallic or wooden veneers. Its interiors are done up with extensive use of ARTICO leather upholstery and highlighted with chrome accents. Its dashboard has star-shaped AC vents garnished with silver accents. The dashboard in the cockpit looks quite sleeker than other company models and is equipped with an array of features. Some of those include a music system, an AC unit along with an instrument cluster and a multi-information display. Also, there is an attractive 3-spoke steering wheel with leather cover and is mounted with multi-functional switches. But the most important factor of the cabin is that it is furnished with comfortable seats, which redefines the ergonomics. The rear cabin seat has a split folding facility in 60:40 ratio, which is helpful for extending the boot volume. Its internal cabin is fitted with an array of utility features including storage boxes, drink holders, sun visors, accessory power sockets and digital clock.Interior Comfort:This model series is packed with a range of sophisticated features that eventually offers an unmatched driving experience. Currently, it is available in two trim levels like Style and Sport. Among these, 'Style' is the base trim, which has all the standard features including an automatic air conditioning system, rear adjustable AC vents, dust along with pollen filter. This trim also comprises of information based features like a speedometer, fuel gauge, tachometer, outside temperature, digital clock, and gearshift position notifier. Beside these, it also has ECO start/stop function, 4-way lumber support for front seats, large glove box unit, adjustable power steering column, memory function for driver's seat, power windows with one touch operation, electrically adjustable outside mirrors, multi-functional steering wheel and remote operation for boot opening center armrest for front and rear. On the other hand, its high end 'Sport' variant has features like panoramic sliding sunroof with automatic rain sensing function, adjustable armrest, trip computer in multi-functional display and illuminated glove compartment. The manufacturer has also blessed this variant with a sophisticated PARKTRONIC parking assist function featuring rear sensors and camera, which offers acoustic and visual parking aid on infotainment screen.Interior Measurements:As for the dimensions of insides, its front cabin has a total headroom of 1015mm along with a decent leg room of 532mm. Its rear cabin has a total head space of 971mm, 1410mm of shoulder space and leg space of 494mm. This vehicle also has a total 421 litres of boot volume, whose capacity can be extended further with the help of 60:40 split folding second row seat.Ed's take : The acceleration of the GL-Class is good, and the seven gears help to spread the torque more evenly. The GL 63 AMG does a naught to 100km/hr in under 5 seconds. Being mated with 7-speed DSG automatic transmission gearbox, both the power plants scores high with regards to acceleration and pickup. They can achieve a top speed in the range of 205 Kmph. As far as pickup is concerned, its oil-burners can break the 100 Kmph speed mark from a standstill in 9.9 seconds, while the petrol trims can do it in just 7.6 seconds.Ed's take: The GL-Class now has better power to weight ratio, despite the same engine and the drivability has always been good. The only thing that we dislike is the responsiveness of the transmission. The petrol version is powered by a 2.0-litre, in-line drive-train that is integrated with variable valve control technology and direct fuel injection system. This power plant comprises of 4-cylinders and 16-valves altogether making a displacement capacity of 1991cc. This DOHC based mill is also integrated with a turbocharger that helps it to deliver a maximum power of 181bhp at 5500rpm in combination with 300Nm of pounding torque between just 1200 to 4000rpm. While its diesel variants draw power from a 2.2-litre oil-burner that has the latest generation common rail fuel injection system. This motor is also based on DOHC valve configuration featuring 4-cylinders along with 16-valves, which displaces 2143cc. This motor is integrated with high pressure Piezo injectors that enables it to produce a maximum power of 134bhp in the range of 3600 to 4400rpm and yields a superior torque output of 300Nm between 1600 to 3000rpm. The car maker has paired both these motors with an efficient 7-speed DSG automatic transmission gearbox that releases the torque output to its front wheels.Ed's take : Buyers of GL-Class do not worry about efficiency, still the GL-Class is generous with its fuel consumption. Especially, the GL 63 AMG owners which is the most powerful SUV in India at the moment. Its oil-burner is integrated with a critically acclaimed CRDI fuel injection system featuring Piezo injectors. These are high pressure injectors, which enables the power plant to unleash immense power and at the same time, they also helps to deliver a maximum mileage of 17.7 Kmpl. While its petrol engine is incorporated with a conventional direct fuel injection system. This empowers the SUV to give away a maximum mileage in the range of 12 to 14 Kmpl.Ed's take : The power produced by the GL-Class is good on paper and we have liked this 3.0-litre V6 diesel mill. The GL 63 AMG is the most powerful SUV in India with about 550bhp of power available on tap. Its 4-cylindered diesel drive-train is based on DOHC configuration and displaces 2143cc. This turbocharged motor has the ability to churn out a maximum power of 134.1bhp in combination with 300Nm of hammering torque. Its petrol motor is also based on a 4-cylinder configuration and is integrated with variable valve control technology for optimum power generation. It can belt out 181.03bhp of maximum power along with 300Nm of hammering torque.Ed's take: Mercedes-Benz has ensured that the GL-Class comes loaded with several accessories and a huge list is also available as an option. Its entry level trim gets a cutting-edge central media system featuring 14.7cm touchscreen. It also comprises of a CD player, radio tuner along with connectivity ports for AUX-In and USB devices. Also, there is Bluetooth connectivity for seamless audio streaming and for in-cabin telephonic operation. Its high end trim on the other hand is also blessed with a 450W surround system system designed by Harman Kardon. It delivers superior quality sound output with the help of 9 loudspeakers and 9-channel DSP amplifier.Ed's take : The GL-Class drives just like a car. This is the biggest advantage that it possesses. The handling of the AMG is definitely much better than the conventional E-Class. This SUV is bestowed with 'comfort' suspension system comprising multilink system for its rear axle and an independent strut suspension for the front one. In terms of braking, its front wheels are fitted with a sturdy set of ventilated disc brakes, whereas its rear ones are coupled to solid disc brakes. Aiding this mechanism is the anti lock braking system that works in combination with brake assist function to reduce the possibility of skidding. In addition to these, this SUV gets a latest generation electronic stability program that works in collaboration with curve dynamic and hill hold assist.Ed's take: The safety features list is long on the GL-Class as it gets airbags, ABS, ESP, hill-assist, PRE-SAFE etc. This SUV is built with high strength aluminum material, which is quite rigid and capable of dealing with collisions. It comprises of side impact protection beams and crumple zones at critical areas for added safety. As for the features front. both the trims in this series are equipped with identical safety functions. Some of those include seven airbags, three point ELR seat belts, head restraints, driver's seat belt warning, door open indicator, rear parking sensors, seat occupancy recognition system for front passenger, collapsible steering wheel and anti-glare inside rear view mirrors. Besides these, they also have an advanced engine immobilizer system with rolling code, remote central locking system including unlocking of doors, anti-theft alarm, and protective under-body guard. The manufacturer has also incorporated it with sophisticated programs like electronic stability control, dynamic curve assist, hill hold assist, anti lock braking system, anti slip regulation, and brake assist function.Both the trims level in this model series have been bestowed with a set of 18-inch, 5-twin spoke design alloy wheels. The only difference is that the 'Style' trim gets these rims with high-sheen black finish, whereas in top end variant, they have vandanium silver finish. These rims are wrapped with 235/50 R18 sized tubeless radial tyres for better grip on any road condition.1. Its internal cabin has better space than expected. 2. Compact size helps it to glide through traffic easily. 3. Comfort aspects are far better than other competitors. 4. Engine performance along with acceleration is quite good. 5. This is the first vehicle in its segment to have seven airbags.1. More options can be given to customize its interior design and color scheme. 2. Fuel economy of petrol motor is rather poor. 3. Price range can be more competitive. 4. Head room is not as good as other SUVs. 5. There is still scope to improve its minimum ground clearance."

sS'Mercedes-Benz GLC'

S"Introduction:Mercedes-Benz is a brand that has stood the test of time. Its vehicles have been well received across the world, and despite growing domestic competition, the company has seen very favourable performance here in India as well. The GLC class is a vehicle that the brand unveiled at the Auto-Expo 2016, and having gotten a glimpse of what the machine was all about, we'd expect any car-lover to count the days down to the model's release. In the meantime, we're here to spill everything we've gathered about the vehicle, and leave you with a sense of eagerness for its release. Pros:1. Muscular exterior format, sure to get heads turning when driving down the road.2. Lavished interiors that very few vehicles could match.Cons:1. Its performance quality could be improved.2. The tall price range is probably its greatest downside.Stand-out Features:1. It comes with a list of very advanced entertainment and comfort features that most people would find mesmerising.2. The presence of strong techno programs such as Electronic stability control and many others get a definite thumbs up from us.Overall:Mercedes-Benz is the type of brand that brings together the best that people could ask for, encapsulating it in the form of a vehicle. The GLC class is an SUV streamlined for a smaller, sportier appearance, and we thought this was brilliant. The exterior modelling was close to perfect, and we found it very hard to flush out flaws in the design. The vehicle has been given a more aesthetic layout with the low and slender shape, and the alluring details. Coming to the interior, we were happy to see just what we expected from this cabin: From the fine wooden inlays to the polished surfaces, we thought that the inner design brims with a sense of eloquence and purity, and the presence of many comfort features only strengthens this. Although the vehicle hasn't been launched yet, we're quite sure of its inner specs, from the engine to the transmission. 2.0-litre engines would power it in both petrol and diesel versions, while many some pretty strong safety shields complete the overall experience and render it flawless. Exteriors:Images of the vehicle on the web leave you with the impression of a well structured, powerful looking vehicle that you don't think twice about loving. We'll admit, the vehicle's robust and masculine stance is nothing like what we've seen in conventional, domestic models. Nevertheless, there are feminine themes that overlap with its strong form, and this is what we thought struck the best look possible. The tall and bulky vehicle has been tailored for a graceful shape, and this brings a modern note in its image. The muscular body lines have been smoothly textured, giving a far more attractive overall delight. It begins drawing viewers in with a face shaped with an aggressive allure, at the focus of which is a large radiator grille.  A thick chrome furnishing stretches across the grille, with the large star-emblem resting at the centre. We know for one that a more distinct image is carved by factors like these, and they ultimate give the vehicle the true grandeur of a Merc. At the bottom, the air intake section is embraced by thick chrome artistry. The headlamp clusters on either side are slim and eye catching, and we thought they complete the picture of the front perfectly. The hood has been refined with subtle lines that we thought made for a more awe-inciting vision. The fine curvatures that run across the bonnet further enhance the look, and there was an overall solidity in the design that we haven't witnessed in any other vehicle of the day. The flawless metallic skin drapes down from the bonnet into the side profile, wrapping over the wheel arches in a neat fashion. There was a more well toned, prominent bearing in the wheel arches that is sure to attract the attention of younger car lovers. When you take a look at the side, you can't help but feel amazed at the serene body lines printed over the door-side. We felt an indomitable spirit of luxury and richness exuded by this set-up, and we'll give the company hats-off for it. The 5-spoke well nurtured alloy wheels are also striking, and the well sculpted design further brings out the best in the vehicle's appearance. As you trace the shape of the vehicle, you find that the rear area has been beefed up nicely, giving a more harmonious exhibition. There was also an element of grace in the structural disposition, so much so much so that the bulky machine almost has the tone of a sports car if viewed from far away. At the rear, the the slender headlamps stretch from the interior of the tail-gate to the side, and we thought there was an inherent, sporty design in them that most people would love. A large chrome strip rests at the bottom of the rear, while the sporty design of the exhaust vents finish the picture off in the cleanest way possible. Interiors:The interiors are large, lavish and comfortable. We've got to tell you, folks, there isn't much that's left behind, and being a Merc, none of its buyers would expect anything less. There is an serene, atmospheric feeling that has been sewn into the place, and it runs over the theme of the car, from the delicate seating to the wood furnished door-sides, the wide dashboard and the eye catching centre console. The powerful ambience has further been strengthened with a host of comfort and convenience features, and all in all, we thought the ride couldn't have gotten any better. At the front, the dashboard has been laid out in a smooth textured, jaw-dropping format, and there is a distinct separation between the glove-box area at the bottom and the top region. The AC vents on either side come with a unique, circular design, and we thought this adds to the in-genuine look of the interior. The upper region of the dashboard has been rests in a higher platform, and when you take a look at this, you can't help but sense a touch of genius in the layout. By the centre of the dash, the large TFT multi-functional display screen gives the entire place a strong, modern look, and we thought this went perfectly with the distinguished aura the vehicle strives to create at every field. The centre console region is adorned with a finely polished wooden surface, and most people would find this irresistible. Three circular AC vents have rest right below the TFT screen, while various control switches are propped below. The centre console slides down in a gentle manner, merging into the adjoining area between the seats. The steering wheel has been moulded with the same, sporty design that conventional vehicles are accustomed to, and the emblem of the brand is perched by the centre for a more distinctive touch. When you take a look at the advanced-looking instrument cluster, you feel the delicacy of the company's design permeate everything within the cabin. The tachometer and the speedometer within come with attractive dials, and both of them are cloaked with large cowls that dish out a pretty impressive statement. Moving away from the dashboard, the doorsides have been lavished the fine wood inlays, and touches of silver within the design make for a more harmonious look. If you ask us, we'd tell you that the seating just can't get any more comfortable. Legroom, headroom and shoulder-room is abundant in both of the rows, while the presence of headrests and armrests adds to the integral experience. The plush leather upholstery brings a far more enriched taste to the ride than any other factor, and we're sure that few people would have a problem there. Performance:The vehicle is based on the C-class, and most of its inner dynamics share a similar platform with the other model. It is supposed to come with engine variants of both petrol and diesel formats. At the petrol front, there is a 2.0-litre trim that levels some decent specs. This includes a power of 211bhp, and a torque of 350Nm. On the diesel end, there is a 2.0-litre engine that comes in two different tuning states. The first pins power and torque values at 170bhp and 400Nm, while the second surpasses this with 204bhp of power and a grinding torque of 500Nm. Both of the mills are expected to come along with a 9G-Tronic automatic gearbox, and we're sure that shifting gears won't get any easier that it does here. Between both the engines, the mileage would vary between 21 to 25kmpl, and with the size and bulk of this machine, this is a figure that is sure to put a smile on many people's faces. Ride and Handling:Most of us would agree that this company just doesn't compromise. Although the vehicle was modelled for and released in markets abroad, you'd be more than justified in imagining a comfortable ride experience here on harsh Indian roads as well. First, strong disc brakes have been clipped onto the front and rear wheels, ensuring that you face no trouble cornering, braking and coming to a quick stop when needed. Aside from this, the chassis arrangement has also been given a robust design on both ends, capable of decimating most road anomalies here. The agility control comfort suspension ensures that most strains you encounter in other vehicles does not hamper your ride here. We haven't gotten the chance to drive the vehicle first hand, but we've drawn inferences from articles circulated online, which point to a rather comfortable, high quality ride that would please most people. The ride stability is further bolstered with some sound techno programs, including the Anti lock braking system, Electronic brake-force distribution, and many more. Safety:You can expect an exhaustive range of safety facilities, seeing as this is a brand that meets very stringent safety standards across the world. It is going to come with ABS and EBD, which together cement safety during the drive by preventing mishaps. Also to be present is an Adaptive brake system, which further boosts the quality of braking. Electronic stability control would help to keep the vehicle in a balanced field when driving, and at the same time, we're sure it eases the burden of handling for the driver as well. Also present would be conventional parameters such as seatbelts, airbags, ISOFIX child seat anchors, a remote boot release system, and perhaps even an electric parking brake. Variants:The vehicle comes in a sole variant, and this makes a fine bonus for many potential buyers. This trim has it all, from exterior cosmetics and comfort to the safety measures and entertainment facilities. The dazzle that you're to expect includes a Burmester surround sound system, a navigation system, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assists, a parking assist, a TCT multi-functional display screen, split folding rear seats, and a massive boot area. Verdict:You can't help but swell with pride as you look at this vehicle live. We'll spell it out bluntly: this is a vehicle that comes with a lot of advantages, and very few disappointments. It has a thrilling look, vibrantly modelled interiors, an over-flowing list of features, many handling aids and decent performance. However, be aware that this is also a rather expensive piece, and something that you might trade for a less priced model if you can compromise on luxury slightly. At the end of the day, this is a vehicle tailored for those with a fat wallet and a desire for the best. For those who just require a modest vehicle that can get the job done, we'd recommend some other model in a completely different range. "

With conventional car makers comfortably settled in less perky areas, the burden of shaping the luxury segment of the vehicle falls on a unique line of brands such as Mercedes-Benz. The GLE 450 AMG Coupe is probably one of the more daring releases for the market, with tough competition from the likes of Audi and BMW. With its own unique niche of designing, the car has borne the brunt of competition in all other countries it has been released in, keeping itself afloat and well ahead. We at Cardekho delve into the many facets of the vehicle to find out exactly where it derives its powerful allure from.Background and Evolution:Originally born more than two decades ago, this model series has a longer history. The model was released in the United States in the year 1997, initially borne with the name, 'M-Class'. In 2001, the vehicle received a facelift, with many significant changes for its exterior including revised front and rear bumpers, new alloy wheels and new headlamp lenses. In 2005, the second generation of the model came out, and it boasted impressive new features such as a 7G-Tronic gearbox, Bi-Xenon headlamps and an adjustable air based suspension. The current version in market was unveiled in 2011, and it came with a slew of modern features such as an adaptive cruise control, an active curve system and anti roll bars to support the suspension.Exteriors:The SUV comes with a husky format that has not been seen among SUVs from major Indian manufacturers. Its majestic demeanour would overshadow any other vehicle, while at the same time, imbibing some serious class into its menacing stature. Standing before the vehicle, we were given a first imprint of awe at its powerful position, but the enriched design scheme takes this quite a bit further.Personally, we found the look of the Coupe variant to be a more enthralling one, and if you're out there for looks over utility, then the dashy appearance of the Coupe is sure to cage your attraction. The gracefully descended rear end and the overall streamlined shape, this variant evokes the more racy flavour in the model series, and is sure to thrill its own niche of customers.Some of the design elements shared between all variants were also worth the exterior gamble. Posted at the front is a wide radiator grille, with two sculpted louvres around the Mercedes star for a more emboldened effect.The headlamp clusters on either side host a variety of lighting units, including LEDs and turn indicators.The accentuated front bumper with its chrome inserts renders a more splendid appeal. This goes in harmony with the under-body protection, which comes with a chrome look finish. The wide hood is glazed with well tendered lines, and in our taste, this perfected the vision of the car's front, balancing its masculine bearing with a more gentle and feminine touch.Stretching over the side of the vehicle is a chrome beltline strip, which imparts a more lavish design to the side profile. There are other subtle lines that breeze through the side of the vehicle, and although they are eclipsed by more prominent features, you're sure to catch a glimpse of them with time.The light alloy wheels add an element of sportiness to the car, and this is further emphasised by the wide and prominent wheel arches.The company goes out of the way to stress the uniqueness of the machine, with aluminium running boards and roof rails that are sure to bring a more energetic effect to the build. We won't lie on the account that the robust make of the vehicle leaves areas of its appeal suffering, but its well balanced structure redeems some of the beauty. The well toned effect at the rear is sure to get your attention, for this gives the entire vehicle a well oriented position.The brand undeniably goes out of the way to display its love for chrome, with a rear sill protector in chrome and tailpipes plated with chrome. If you're the race-loving type, the well integrated roof spoiler is sure to get your attention, while the sporty twin-pipe exhausts cements the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s all flavoured build.Personally, we found the look of the Coupe variant to be a more enthralling one, and if you're out there for looks over utility, then the dashy appearance of the Coupe is sure to cage your attraction. The gracefully descended rear end and the overall streamlined shape, this variant evokes the more racy flavour in the model series, and is sure to thrill its own niche of customers. Observers would be quick to note its well balanced dimensions, with a length of 4819mm, a width of 2141mm and height of 1796mm.A boot space of 690-litres is all too good for even the most avid camper, and this figure towers well before most other competitors in the space.Interiors:The spacious and fulfilling layout of the cabin is sure to take you by surprise. But more than this, it is the more sensual nature of the build that would garner approval. It is needless to say that this brand has captivated the most luxurious interior arrangement in any model rolled out by them, and this vehicle stays true to this ideal.The Coupe's cabin may deter those looking for space and luxury, but what it lacks in space, it makes up abundantly in style. The sportily designed steering wheel has been posted with the brand emblem at the centre. The instrument panel has been positioned within arm's reach, along with the gear shifter and other elements. We found this to reduce the burden quite a bit. The instrument dials have been hosted strategically behind the steering wheel, and this is also a bonus for the man behind the wheel.Moving on to the existing variants, the front panel, the wide seats, the centre console, the door-sides and the steering wheel are positioned for a picture of harmony and elegance.Perhaps the most accomplished artistry that you'd ask for lies in the seats. Besides being comfortable and ergonomically designed, the seats are dressed in ARTICO black leather that is man-made, giving the customer a rarely found human touch to the insides of a machine. We feel that that the presence of headrests and armrests adds to the delight of the experience.Headlining is present in crystal grey fabric as well as porcelain fabric, and this interacts with the rest of the car's design to form a more vibrant atmosphere altogether.If you're the type that enjoys inlays of wood, this car provides more than you could ask for, with high quality brown wood furnishing areas of the cabin.Most of us would agree that the most striking element of design on the inside of this car would be the door sill panels that come along with the 'Mercedes-Benz' lettering, carving a more distinguished effect for this cabin.

You won\xe2\x80\x99t notice any form of vibration or any sound disturbance from the engine.The brand is offering another diesel engine as well, an in-line 4-cylinder 2143cc plant, which unleashes 204bhp at 3800rpm and a torque of 500Nm at 1600rpm to 1800rpm. We've got to tell you that these are pretty sharp figures when placed against competitors in the segment, although there are many SUVs, which could far outperform this one. We found no disturbances with the running of the engine, but some might be quick to notice a very mild hum from the engine. The driver would relish the experience with a 9G-Tronic automatic transmission that helps to relieve a lot of the drive strain and bring a more enjoyable experience.Petrol EngineThe newly launched GLE 450 AMG Coupe is powered by a 3.0-litre V-Type petrol mill, which is capable of unleashing 367bhp in combination with a torque of 520Nm. We at CarDekho expect this to be of reasonable performance, especially considering the figures unearthed. Although it lags behind some other competitors, most people looking for a balance between luxury and power would be more than happy with it, considering that an acceleration rate of 5.7 seconds is more than a loud figure for an SUV.Ride and Handling:This company may not have experienced Indian roads first hand, but its overall design sophistication seems to be adept at tackling these conditions. We were more than happy with the alignment, balance and overall stability of the drive, and we'll assure you this might strike you as quite an achievement considering the vehicle's husky mass. The company has equipped the vehicle with strong steel springs to absorb any road strains. A selective damping system also plays a major role in securing ride comfort, with the ability to re-adapt itself according to the drive situation. Any lay-dweller would be impressed with the company's sophisticated build diagram. While most other manufacturers stop with a strong chassis alignment and good brakes, here is a company that has taken the liberty of programming many efficient aid programs to greatly bolster safety for the occupants. Among these is the anti lock braking system, the electronic stability program, as well as a downhill speed regulation facility. An extraordinary ease of handling is granted by the direct-steer system, which boosts response and provides assistance during demanding situation. All of this interacts to shape a truly stress-free drive experience for anyone, although rare bumps and jerks are to be expected.Safety:The factor that impressed us more than anything else was the vehicle's safety arrangements. There were conventional features such as airbags, 3-point seatbelts, childproof doors and seatbelt warning signals. Aside from these, this vehicle boasts many out of the box unconventional features that would surprise many as well. This includes the acceleration skid control program, the brake assist that comes along with brake servo assistance, a crosswind assistance and a seat occupancy recognition for the front passenger.Variants:Verdict:This is a vehicle that has a very clear positive verdict, with its enthralling design, its expensive interiors, its powerful engine and a range of rarely seen before comfort features.

It can help the vehicle to break the 100 Kmph mark in mere 7.8 seconds. On the other hand, it can reach a top speed of 220 Kmph.This newly launched luxury SUV is launched in two trims with a diesel mill as standard under the hood.

sS'Maruti S-Cross'

S'IntroductionThe urban/compact SUV is undoubtedly the fastest growing segment in India currently. Renault first explored the space with its Duster, and then almost every car manufacturer tried to grab its share. However India\xe2\x80\x99s largest car manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki remained detached from the game. Mid - 2015, MSIL shed it\xe2\x80\x99s cheap and cheerful image and established a sub-brand called \xe2\x80\x98Nexa\xe2\x80\x99 to sell its premium offerings. Alongside the showrooms, an all new S-Cross debuted as well. Now, Maruti insists that the car in question isn\xe2\x80\x99t a compact SUV or a hatchback on stilts. They say, it is a \xe2\x80\x98premium crossover\xe2\x80\x99. Does the S-Cross justify the tag? Let\xe2\x80\x99s find out. Pros:1. Powerful 1.6-litre diesel engine with segment-best 320 Nm of maximum torque.2. Roomy cabin - can seat 5 people in relative comfort.3. Mature ride quality, handles uneven roads easily.4. Loaded with features: projector headlamps, 7" touchscreen infotainment, leather seats, cruise control  etcCons:1. No petrol engine option. Petrol engine could have brought the starting price down.2. Average boot space @ 353 litres. A much smaller Honda Jazz gets a similar capacity boot.3. No automatic variant (like the Creta) or AWD (like the Duster)Stand out features:1. All wheel disc-brakes standard. Only car in its class to have this.2. Dual airbags standard across the range save for the base variant (it gets driver airbag only).Overview:Internationally, the car is known as the SX4 S-Cross, but keeping the SX4\'s rather forgettable stint in mind, the carmaker has dropped the SX4 prefix for India. Not just this, they have also axed the \'Maruti Suzuki\' badge from the boot lid, so you\'ll just see the Suzuki nameplate there.This is the first Maruti that\xe2\x80\x99s being retailed through the premium Nexa dealerships, and not via the regular network. Service facilities however, are being shared.ExteriorsLike the S-Cross, all cars in this segment including the Duster, Terrano, Creta and even the smaller EcoSport are crossovers. But while the rest go out of their way to ape the styling of butch, rugged SUVs, the S-Cross doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest, the S-Cross\' design isn\'t jaw-dropping, nor is it outright bad. It\xe2\x80\x99s a simple looking car which won\xe2\x80\x99t attract many eyeballs and no heads will turn when it will pass by. Those desiring macho looks and glamorous styling that made the S-Cross\xe2\x80\x99 closest rival (read : Creta) a blockbuster \xe2\x80\x93 is missing on the Maruti. The S-Cross\' front fascia reminded us of the discontinued SX4 sedan. The large headlights and the stubby nose do have hints of the old SX4.  There\xe2\x80\x99s abundant bling up front in form of the silver accents in the headlights and the chrome on the foglamp housing. Not to mention, the  two slat radiator grill is finished in chrome too and  bears a huge, \'S\' logo.  Post the bling elements \xe2\x80\x93 you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice matte silver accents on the front & rear skid plates and on the side skirts as well. Even the roof rails are painted silver and all these together add some subtleness to the otherwise bling design.Speaking of bland designs, the alloy wheels really should have been styled differently. These 16-inchers can easily be mistaken for plastic wheel caps; though we started loving it after we saw the ones on Baleno. Talking about the rear, there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong shoulder line emanating from the edge of the headlamp, which cuts across the door handles and meets the tail-lamps. The tail-lights have a hint of EcoSport to them, which according to us, is not a bad thing. The space between the tail-lamps forms a neat little hexagon that enhances the appeal at rear.The S-Cross, despite of its rather generous proportions comes across as a car that blends in the crowd. There simply isn\xe2\x80\x99t a \xe2\x80\x98wow factor\xe2\x80\x99 to make you give it a second look.Interiors:Unlike the Ciaz, S-Cross\xe2\x80\x99 interiors carry an all-black theme. Some find the all-black interiors less appealing, but we at Cardekho find it really sporty. So thumbs up for that.  Like the exterior, the interiors also lack that \'wow\xe2\x80\x99 factor. But what you\'ll appreciate is a fuss-free dashboard design with matte silver highlights to break the all-black monotony. Due to the decent glass area all around, the cabin does feel airy. The textured overlay on the dash has a nice, rubbery, soft-touch material. The quality of the plastics could have been better, especially on the switches for the power windows. On the whole, fit and finish across the cabin is neat. A 7\xe2\x80\x9d touchscreen infotainment system forms the bulk of the centre console. The unit goes a long way in reducing the clutter of buttons on the dash. Everything is operated via touch, unlike the Hyundai Creta which gets separate physical buttons for operating the infotainment system. The system can play media from a host of sources like Radio, USB, AUX-in and also gets Bluetooth compatibility for music streaming and calls. It also gets in-built navigation.The steering unit is similar to the one on the Ciaz. It is wrapped in leather and offers nice grip. The wheel gets integrated buttons for the media, Bluetooth telephony and the cruise control. Behind the steering wheel lies the two pod instrument cluster with a cool-blue backlight. It houses an MID sandwiched between two large dials - the rev counter and the speedometer. The MID displays information such as instantaneous efficiency, average efficiency, distance to empty, etc. The seats on the S-Cross have been rather well executed \xe2\x80\x93 upholstered in black leather with contrasting stitching that definitely looks premium and gels with the all black theme of the dash. However, expect these seats to get quite hot in the peak summer days. If you liked the front seats on the Swift, you will love the S-Cross too. The bolstering and cushioning is spot on. The rear bench is quite wide and good enough to accommodate three adults with ease.  Legroom is evidently better than the Creta and the headroom is on the higher side as well. The sad part - rear bench passengers, neither get a rear AC, nor do they have a charging socket.  We feel the rear AC shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been omitted, especially since the car gets an all-black interior that tends to heat up. Boot Space is average at 353 litres. The Duster leads the pack with a massive 475 litres of cargo volume.The  top-spec Alpha variant comes with keyless entry, push button start, cruise control, a touchscreen infotainment system with navigation, reverse camera, automatic climate control - the lot!  Maruti seems to have taken a leaf out of Hyundai\xe2\x80\x99s books and have loaded the S-Cross with a lot of kit. The quality is definitely a couple of notches above the standard Maruti fare as well. Overall, a simple but plush cabin from the largest automakers in the country.Performance:Maruti did a Mahindra with the S-Cross. It went all-diesel with this crossover, offering a choice of two Fiat-sourced engines \xe2\x80\x93 the tried-tested 1,248 cc unit (1.3-litre) and the more powerful 1,598 cc mill (1.6-litre).S-Cross 1.3 (DDiS200)The 1.3-litre diesel is mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox with power and torque figures identical to the Ciaz, i.e. 89 BHP at 4,000 rpm and 200 Nm of peak torque at 1,750 rpm. Do we need to say that the less-powered variant with the 1.3-litre engine performs in a rather regular and ordinary manner. The same engine, in a similar state of tune can be found in the Ciaz. The engine behaves identically. There is turbo lag before 2000rpm, after which the motor pulls cleanly. In comparison, the 1.4 litre motor on the Creta has better low-end grunt. However, the S-Cross is the more efficient pick between the two.We have to say that the 1.3 motor does not feel all that underpowered for the size and the bulk of the S-Cross. However, better performance is always welcome. S-Cross 1.6 (DDiS320)If performance is what you\'re looking for, then the imported 1.6-litre engine will surely impress you. The mill promises 118 BHP @ 3,750 rpm and best-in-segment 320 Nm of torque @ 1,750 rpm. This unit is mated to a 6-speed manual gearbox. The DDiS320 is brilliant to drive and has a nice punch, but only after 2000rpm. In fact, if you aren\xe2\x80\x99t careful, you might even stall the S-Cross when you are cantering around under 2000 rpm. It requires regular downshifts to keep engine alive, which might act a bit irritating in traffic.Compared to the Creta 1.6, the S-Cross is definitely more fun to drive. The surge of torque is addictive at times and will have you grinning from ear to ear when you let it loose! Ride & Handling:The S-Cross has a relatively mature ride quality. A notch higher than it\xe2\x80\x99s direct rival - the Creta, dare we say. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bouncy as the Korean rival and definitely feels more sure footed when on the highways like a European offering. The suspension isn\xe2\x80\x99t soft and neither too stiff \xe2\x80\x93 in short, very much like the Swift. The car does manage to tackle potholes and broken roads with relative ease. The straight-line stability is fantastic \xe2\x80\x93 best from Maruti Suzuki till date. The S-Cross feels stable and eager to change direction, even during triple digit speeds. Due to the crossover-ish ground clearance of 180 mm, there is inevitable body roll when chucked fast into a corner. But, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t as bad as, say a Duster/Terrano. Maruti has managed well to strike a nice balance between ride and handling with the S-Cross. The car isn\xe2\x80\x99t uncomfortable and at the same time won\xe2\x80\x99t deter you from pushing it into a corner. The steering feedback is impressive. In fact, for an EPS(Electric Power Steering) \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s quite good. Like most of the new age Marutis, the S-Cross\xe2\x80\x99 steering also feels direct.The S-Cross also gets all wheel disc brakes as standard. Again, we have to appreciate Maruti\xe2\x80\x99s outlook for safety here. Braking is a no-frills affair - the car sheds speeds quickly without waving out of line.  \nSafety: In terms of safety, all trims of the S-Cross are loaded with Anti Lock Brakes and Electronic Brake Distribution. Another great addition is disc brakes all around where the convention is to have disc brakes only at the front and drums at the rear. The S Cross also comes with dual front airbags (Driver + Passenger) as standard (Base Trim Gets only driver side airbag). All of these are welcome additions and shows Marutis growing focus towards passenger safety. The Indian spec S-Cross hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been through a crash test yet but the S-Cross for the south east asian market was put through ASEAN NCAP crash tests and scored a full 5 stars. However, the variant that was tested had 7 Airbags which is not on offer in India.  Variants: The S-Cross is offered in a total of 5 trim levels. The base Sigma trim misses out on essential safety features like the passenger side airbag, seatbelt pretensioners and force limiters. We feel these are essential safety requirements and opt for the Sigma (O) instead of the Sigma in case you are on a budget. While the Delta trim starts showing few signs of premium features such as the reversing sensors and entertainment system, we highly recommend going for the Zeta trim as it will give the real feeling of premium features. If you do not want to compromise on the features, go for the ALpha trim as it includes Apple\xe2\x80\x99s Carplay System, Climate Control and a premium leather upholstery.\n Verdict:The S-Cross is undoubtedly the best attempt from Maruti Suzuki in recent time. While most of the offering in this space are hatch-converted crossovers, the S-Cross stands tall as a \xe2\x80\x98built from scratch\xe2\x80\x99 crossover. Class-leading features, great engine, good build quality and ample space make it a great package. Though, don\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to act like a compact SUV or an off-roader.It is definitely a \xe2\x80\x98premium crossover\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 as per Maruti\xe2\x80\x99s standards. With the recent price correction, the S-Cross comes across as an even more well-rounded package.'
