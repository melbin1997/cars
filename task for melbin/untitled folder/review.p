One among them is the Mahindra E Verito - an electric car that was earlier showcased at the 2014 Auto Expo as well. Its starting price is expected to be somewhere around Rs. 8 lakhs. Only a few details are out as of now about the features it carries and hence, one has to just wait for its arrival and see what it has to offer.Pros:1. Huge cabin and boot space. This sedan is likely to provide sufficient leg and shoulder room besides providing good luggage storage capacity.Cons:1. Seems like it does not get an any update design wise, which would have been an advantage otherwise.Stand Out Features1. 72V induction motor that is said to generate decent power output besides delivering smooth performance.OverviewThis electric version has indeed managed to grab many eyeballs at the grand event in Delhi. If reports are to be believed, this vehicle might hit the market by the end of February or in the early March, 2016. Going into details, this machine will be launched in three trim levels, which are D2, D4 and D6. This is said to feature an electric motor under the bonnet, which is currently doing duty in the Mahindra e2o. As per the sources, it will be a 72V 3-phase AC induction motor that is said to generate about 41bhp along with torque output of 91Nm. Except for the technicalities, it has the same design and look as of Verito, and we can also expect it to carry most of the latter's features as well. It is speculated to get refreshed interiors with an attractive color scheme and modern equipments. It is likely to have a new music system and AC unit controls, while other elements might include a power steering column, bottle holder, vanity mirror on co-passenger side and a few others. On the safety front, we can look forward for attributes like adjustable front seat belts, anti theft engine immobilizer and child proof rear door locks as well.

These might probably come with halogen headlamps and turn indicators as well.Bonnet looks a bit plain, whereas the windscreen is pretty large in size with a couple of wipers integrated to it.Its side profile looks a bit different and indeed better than the fuel based version. No doubt, it is because of the attractive body graphics on doors that is adding to its style quotient.According to some reports, it will get a set of 14 inch, ten spoke styled alloy wheels probably for the top spec range. It is also being rumored to be offered with low rolling resistance tubeless tyres of size 185/70 R14.Also seen on its sides are the well designed outside rear view mirrors that may not have side turn indicators even in the top end models.In the rear, the e-Verito badge is noticed on the top right side of the boot lid.

On the other hand, it is also rumored to come with a fast charging mode that reduces the charge rate to less than 1.5 hours. However, this feature is will mostly be available in its top end D6 trim.Ride and HandlingThe front wheels of this stylish sedan might be equipped with disc brakes, whereas the rear ones are likely to have drum brakes. Also, the advanced anti lock braking system is anticipated but only in the top end variant. In terms of suspension, it may be assembled with a McPherson strut on the front axle and a torsion beam on the rear one. Alike in the other version, this one too is expected to be offered with a power steering column that will aid in easy maneuverability.Safety This vehicle from Mahindra is anticipated to carry some vital security aspects that may provide high level of protection to its passengers. Some of these might include the driver airbag, adjustable front seat belts and child proof rear door locks. Other key attributes like ABS with EBD, engine immobilizer, and central locking system are also expected.VariantsAs per the information available so far, this vehicle may be introduced in three trim levels as in the other version. The D2 will be the entry level variant, while D4 and D6 will be the mid and top end models respectively.VerdictWe at CarDekho, would say that the company's idea of bringing it in the electric version is indeed a good move. But at the same time, it would have been better if, it gets a few more additions and improvements in all aspects. Meanwhile, the price factor may also turn out a setback as several buyers might not be ready to empty their pockets for a vehicle with such limited features. However, if you are planning to go green and save the environment at least to some extent then, you may prefer this upcoming model."

sS'Honda Brio'
p11
S"Overall:Honda has found a perfect haven here in India. The company's models are tailored to meet the needs of the general masses, and most of them fared well in the market. The Brio was launched five years back, and since then, it's risen to a good position in the market, so that today most people glimpse the vehicle on their street. Designed with a unique and compact presence, the car invokes a persona never seen in a vehicle before. As we delve through the many sides of the machine, we'd have ample room to find out where it stands out and where it could do better. Pros:1. Handling is very good.2. Many strong comfort features within.Cons:1. Some might find the cabin small and cramped.2. Most of the good features are not present in the low end trims.Stand-Out Features:1. The Integrated Honda Audio system comes along with radio facility, MP3, USB, Aux-In and many more functions.Overview:The vehicle is designed with the purpose of satisfying the varying needs of an average Indian consumer. Powering the machine is a 1.2-litre petrol engine that displaces 1198cc. The engine combines decent performance with a good fuel economy, slotting a mileage of 19.4kmpl. The engine prowess is balanced by a robust chassis, along with many sound safety elements. Coming to the outside, we thought the car's design was fascinating, but some might find the fresh new theme odd. Some plush features animate the look, such as chrome touches, black window frames, and the fine curves. The interior has been given a serene atmosphere. The interaction of the colors and materials in the place makes a more dynamic air. The higher end variants come with a slew of good features, from a radio system to power windows, adjustable seating, an air conditioner with a heater and many more. Exteriors:The car makes its mark with a small and compact body profile, which has also been honed for a racy edge. We thought that the well sculpted wheel arches, neat body lines and agile posture together gave the machine a bold demeanor. At the front, the grille has been furnished with a chrome strip with the company's emblem at the center. The teardrop shaped headlamps have been incorporated with halogen lights and all necessary lighting units. Meanwhile, the broad front skirts wrap over a thin air dam at the bottom, with fog lamps by the corner. The car's streamlined position leaves its bonnet sinking towards the front, and this creates a more attractive impression at the front. The clean design of the hood, devoid of lines and creases, set the car apart in our opinion. The distinct wheel arches, together with the stylish wheels, throw some vigor on the side profile. The subtle creases that run through the door-sides also add to the image, and we thought that the overall effect was brilliant. The door handles and outside mirrors wear the color of the body, and this stirs some fervor in the look. The black highlights on the door frames went along with the image perfectly in our opinion. When you take a look at the rear side of the vehicle, you feel a more distinguished pulse in the look. The tail region looks unlike any other we've seen before. The large rear window at the center and the small tail-lamps by the corner are perfectly aligned. The lower portion of the rear is broader and heavier, and we thought this did spell an odd feel for the image at the rear. Interiors:The cabin is not large, and we've got nothing to hide here. Considering the size of the vehicle, it would be too much to ask for large and spacious interiors. Nevertheless, the presence of some attractive design elements does make up for this, so what the car takes in terms of space, it gives back in the form of a strong drive environment. For the higher end variants, there is a dual tone color theme, and we thought this was great. For the lower end variants, the single tone scheme does lack some splendor. For the top end variant, the dash has been cloaked with an attractive blend of black and beige. The black region covers the top half, spreading down over the center and the floor console in a manner that we thought was attractive. The lower region of the dash, draping over the glove-box region, is colored in Beige for a more balanced effect. Circular AC vents have been evenly posted over the upper region of the dash. Housed at the top of the console is the music system, and the controls to the seating and AC are clustered below. A decent storage area opens out over the floor console, which includes two cup holders before the shifter. We thought that the steering wheel had a striking character, while the Honda label and silver accents further accentuate this effect. A brief overhead hanging stretches over the instrument cluster, which hosts a tachometer, speedometer and other vital readings. The door-sides have been colored in Beige, with a black strip that runs over the door-handle. Nominal storage pockets have been included in the door-sides, but we thought they were too shallow to hold anything substantial. The seats have been given adequate support, while the broad headrests further help relieve strain during the drive. We weren't as happy with the upholstery however, and those accustomed to more lavish ride set-ups would also feel let down. Performance:Packed within the vehicle is a 1.2-litre SOHC based i-VTEC petrol engine that comprises 4 cylinders and 16 valves. It displaces 1198cc, and generates a power of 86.8bhp at 6000rpm, along with 109Nm of torque at 4500rpm. A 5-speed manual transmission is armed along with the engine, and we thought that shifting was smooth and easy. A smooth power delivery works along with the engine, but we thought that the throttle response could have been better. Nevertheless, the engine paves the way for a thrilling ride with a solid sprinting capacity. The second gear allows the car to settle in neck deep traffic comfortably, without the need to downshift, and this makes it ideal for big city commuters. The engine noise and vibration were contained, but very high speeds do ruffle the engine a bit. Ride and Handling:For the braking section, discs at the front and drums at the rear solidify control. Meanwhile, the chassis is composed of a McPherson strut and a torsion beam. Coil springs have been rigged onto both axles, helping to improve stability when driving. We thought that the ride comfort was upto the mark, and the car tackles normal road anomalies with ease. The flow can be hampered at higher speeds and rougher grounds, but it's not nearly as distressing as in some other domestic models. The steering was on the lighter side, and the response was great. We had no issues with braking either, and the light weight and compact set-up of the car enables an ease in taking corners and turning.Safety:We were quite happy with the safety features, which exceed what most domestic brands offer. The downside, however, is that some of the more vital features are absent for the lower end trims. First, the car has been sculpted with a strong ACE body structure, and this helps to minimize damage in case of a mishap. The higher end variants come along with Anti-lock braking system and Electronic brakeforce distribution, and this further strengthens control during the drive. Dual SRS airbags shield the front passengers, but they are not present in the low end variants. Apart from these, standard features include a rear windshield defogger, a driver's seat belt reminder, a day/night interior rear view mirror, and a high mounted stop lamp. An immobilizer guards the vehicle as well, preventing unwanted entry and theft. Variants:There are 5 trim levels, E, EX, S, V, VX. Starting off, the entry level E trim comes with body colored bumpers, a foldable rear seat structure, a driver's seatbelt reminder, front power windows and a fuel consumption display. Next, the mid range trims between EX and V come with some added cosmetics and functions. This includes a chrome grille, body colored OVRMs and door handles, a 1 DIN audio system with USB and Aux-In and a tachometer, rear power windows, a rear parcel shelf and an accessory socket. The top end trim, VX has everything the model series has to offer. This includes alloy wheels, front seatbelts with pretension, power foldable outside mirrors, and many more. Verdict:The Brio is a fancy vehicle, and it appeals to a niche of people. Some of its strengths include a distinct look, stylish interiors and some good comfort and entertainment features.

S"India's largest SUV manufacturer, Mahindra and Mahindra has done wonders in the utility vehicle segment by offering rugged vehicles fitted with power packed engines under the hood. The company has also ventured in to the electric vehicle segment with its Reva e2o last year. It is currently available for sale in two variants, which are T01 and T2. Initially, when these models were launched, they have received decent response from the buyers. Now to add to the customer excitement, the manufacturer has reduced the price tag of this sophisticated electric car by significant amount of approximately Rs 1.0 lakh. The reason for this is because of the Indian government's incentives for the plug-in based electric vehicles. Since this is a full-fledged electric car, it has qualified for all the subsidies that are provided by the Government. This has also helped the manufacturer to offer attractive packages to its customers. For example, if we talk about the price of its base T2 trim in New Delhi, post subsidy, it costs around 5.92 lakh (ex-showroom). However, customers need to pay a fee of Rs. 2999/- per month for the maintenance of battery as part of this vehicle's car protection plan. In case if the customer is not interested in paying the monthly fee, they can opt out of this protection plan, which requires them to pay the full price for the battery. This means that the price of the T2 trim will cost around 7.51 lakh (ex-showroom, New Delhi).

p33
S"Introduction:For more than forty years, BMW 3 Series has been one of the most desired luxury sedans in its class. Its low cost of running and incredible driving dynamics earned it fame like no other. The 3 Series sedan from German auto giant competes with numerous rivals in its segment and the closest one being the Audi A4 and Mercedes C Class. Despite tough competition, it has never lost its ground and continues to live-up to the expectations of many. This small BMW beast has literally turned the tide for the manufacturer in India by emerging one of the best-selling luxury cars in the country.Pros:1. Its 2.0-litre twin-power turbo diesel engine is now the most powerful in its class.2. It is packed with state-of-the-art features and cutting-edge technologyCons:1.

BMW Driver experience control with four different modes. It's Sport + mode unleashes the real performer within.2. Rear wheel drive makes for the 50:50 load distribution and offers superior ride quality.Background and Evolution:BMW 3 Series has been present in India for a while now and is currently serving its sixth generation. Although it is present in the automobile world for more than forty years, 3-series entered India only after 2007 with its fifth generation followed by its sixth generation in the year 2012.Overview:The German auto giant BMW has launched the facelift version of its smallest luxury sedan here in India, ahead of the upcoming auto expo. It was initially scheduled for a launch in February during the auto show, but company pushed its launch days ahead. The 2016 3 series flaunts a slightly tweaked headlight cluster with full LED headlamps and new LED daytime running lights. The manufacturer has also made subtle changes to the interiors as well. A new variant coded 320d M Sport has been added to the series, while retaining all the existing variants. For now, this sedan series is available with just a 2.0-litre diesel engine option. Its power output has been increased to 190bhp from 184bhp of its outgoing model.Exteriors:The 2016 3 Series comes with subtle changes on its exteriors. On the front facade, this car gets a redesigned headlight cluster featuring LED headlamps and Daytime running lights. Below this, the bumper gets a new design featuring restructured LED fog lights that dazzles the facet. The overall design language however remains to be the same.This model series also get a new set of 17-inch alloy wheels. These rims are covered with 225/50 R17 sized radial tubeless tyres. However, its entry level prestige trim continues to be on offer with 16 inch alloy wheels. On the other hand, its GT Sport Line gets multi-spoke, 18 inch alloy wheels adorned with tubeless tyres of size 225/50 R18.The taillight cluster at the rear has been restructured and is now equipped with LED brake lights. Apart from these changes, no updates were made to the car.The GT Sport Line has kidney shaped grille with nine slats in high gloss black colour. This is emphasized by the thick chrome surround and the company's emblem is embossed at the tip of its bonnet.Moving to its sides, the high gloss B-pillars and window surrounds in Matte Black finish makes for a stunning appeal. The foldable external mirrors have heating and automatic anti dazzle functions. They are integrated with LED side turn blinkers.What's noticeable in its rear end are luminous tail light cluster equipped with turn indicators and there is also a wide windshield with defogger. The active spoiler on its boot lid not just gives a sporty look, but also helps in its driving dynamics.Although receiving some minor tweaks to its outsides, its overall dimensions remained unaltered. It comes with a length of 4624mm, width of 1811mm, and a height of 1429mm. It has a pretty long wheelbase of 2810mm and a generous ground clearance of 157mm.Interiors:This 2016 version's interior design remains largely identical to its predecessor. The company made few improvements with regards to the cosmetics and quality of materials. Besides careful usage of chrome and high gloss inserts, the company has added a new feature in the form of Ambient lighting system that exudes a sense of luxury and richness inside the cabin.Now, the multi-functional steering wheel is accompanied with paddle shifters that add to the convenience quotient.Everything about the interior is so fascinating right from its two tone color scheme to well cushioned seats. Soon after entering inside, you'll notice the beautifully sculptured central console housed with all the necessary equipments.

It features a fuel gauge, speedometer, rev counter, fuel consumption, warning lights and so on.Both seats in the first row are electrically adjustable, and the driver's seat additionally gets memory function. We found that the seats are well cushioned and comfortable, but not comfortable enough for long distance travelling.The rear cabin is little low with regards to the head space, but it offers better leg and shoulder room. In addition to this, it has a center armrest mounted with two cup holders that adds to the convenience quotient.Overall, we felt that the company could have made more updates to its design rather than focusing just on cosmetics front.Performance:The engine used for 2016 3 Series is the same 2.0-litre 4-pot mill, which is currently performing for outgoing model. However, the 2016 3 Series gets it with minor updates with more power output. As a result, its output has gone up to 190bhp of power that results in 400Nm of torque. This has further improved its acceleration, as it can now break the 100 kmph mark in just 7.2 seconds. We are yet to test this refined version, only then we will be able to make our final judgment. Its 1995cc twin-turbo motor is a gem of an engine and its revs sound sweet and powerful. The presence of two turbo units has certainly added up to its impressive power output and the turbo lag is in negligible levels. Be it a city road or a highway, this motor feels relaxed, even at the speed of 160 kmph. The company claims it can achieve a top speed of 235 kmph. On the other hand, it is capable of returning 18.88 kmpl mileage. The transmission is the same 8-speed automatic unit that transmits engine output to the rear wheels. For now, there is no petrol engine option, but BMW is mulling to introduce it in the next half of 2016.Ride and Handling:Driving a BMW 3 Series is absolute fun, especially on open roads. It features a state-of-the-art steering unit that can adapt the angle of the front wheels enabling it to respond directly to the steering command. The steering wheel is neither light nor hard. It actually feels perfect and responds to each command precisely. Driving this car actually feels safe, thanks to the high performance disc braking mechanism. All the four wheels have been assembled with disc brakes that deliver excellent stopping power. Additionally, anti-lock braking system and cornering brake control system does their job pretty well and helps the car to be stable, while taking sharp curves. Another feature we need to talk about is the advanced suspension. It has a double joint tension strut assembled on its front axle, and the rear one gets a five arm axle. Besides, its rear wheel drive mechanism makes for balance axle load distribution.Safety and Security:This 2016 version retains all its safety features without any updates. It is loaded with a number of crucial features that guarantees passenger security to a great extent. All the occupants are offered with three point seat belts, and additionally have pyrotechnic belt tensioners and force limiters at front. There are as many as six airbags inside the cabin that minimizes the risk of injury for the occupants.The dynamic stability and cornering brake control helps in its stability and prevents it from skidding. It also includes an immobilizer that avoids unauthorized access into the vehicle, while there is also ISOFIX child seat mounting. Protection is further enhanced by its intelligent airbag system, dynamic traction control, central locking, side impact protection beams, run flat indicator, emergency spare wheel and warning triangle with first aid kit.Variants:At present, this BMW 3 Series comes in a total of four variants among which, M Sport is the new trim. Its base trim 'Prestige' misses out on some features like Hi-Fi loudspeaker system, ambient lights package and electric glass roof. Also, it gets standard Sensatec black upholstery instead of leather upholstery. Other remaining features are identical to those in high end variants. To begin with, this series has features like front sliding armrest with storage compartment, 2-zone automatic AC unit with rear vents, multi-functional steering wheel, electrically adjustable front seats and engine start/stop button.Verdict:BMW 3 Series offers a wonderful drive quality and its maintenance cost is considerably low. Now, the car outperforms its rivals by producing more power than any other vehicle in its class. Also, it is one of the safest sedans that you can get in the entry level sedan series. Despite few shortcomings, this is the car that you can bank on."

S"Introduction:Volvo, the Swedish automobile brand is all set to launch a brand new product in the Indian market. It is the Volvo S60 Cross Country, which is nothing but a sportier version of existing S60 sedan. It was displayed for the very first time at the Detroit motor show, which was held in January 2015. It has already been launched in some of the global auto markets like the United States and now it is all set to arrive in India, on 11th of March. By introducing the cross country, the Swedish automaker is looking towards expanding its presence in the region. Last year, the petrol version of the S60 T6 was offered with a price tag of Rs. 42 lac. So now, we are expecting this sporty version to fall in the price bracket of Rs. 45 lakh to 55 lakh. Though, the company's hasn't yet disclosed any information pertaining to the India-bound version. However, we'll try and explore the international version, since the car will arrive as a CBU. Pros:1. Looks like it is well equipped with several comfort features, which will only add to the passenger's convenience.\n2. Expect it to come with advanced safety standards.Cons:1. The speculated price tag seems to be quite high, which might become one of its major drawbacks. Standout features:1. We expect the car to come with IntelliSafe safety features, which would make the car the safest in its class.\n2. City Safety is another benchmark security feature that acts as your co-pilot and applies brakes automatically in case of emergency, when a crash seems eminent. Overview:The upcoming Volvo S60 Cross Country is another breed of 60 series vehicle from Volvo. It is based on the S60 sedan platform, but it looks notably different from the former. This car is slated for a launch on 11th of March. It is likely that Volvo will launch the model in two variants: one with a D4 2.0-litre diesel and another one with a D4 2.4-litre diesel engine. The range topper with a 2.4-litre mill is also likely to come with the AWD drive mechanism. However, the company hasn't disclosed the official details pertaining to the India-bound version. Talking about its looks, this cross sedan is stylish and imposing, with some striking attributes. A few reports state that it might make an appearance with both 18-inch and 19-inch alloy wheels, with high-performance tyres. As for the interiors, we can expect luxury and great comfort from this machine just like other existing models of this brand. Some of the key aspects present in the S60 like reverse parking camera, sunroof, and the sat-navigation system might be carried forward with this one as well. If we talk about safety, it is a known fact that Volvo has always surprised its buyers with several security attributes in all its vehicles, and expect this one to come with the same. Upon its launch, it will be the first car to be offered by the automaker in 2016. ExteriorFrom the pictures which surfaced across the internet, it shows the sporty side of its existing S60 sedan model. The car wears a low and sharp profile that is sure to grab a lot of eyeballs once it enters the market. It's lean position and aerodynamic design will help in keeping it in the best shape for a fast and rough drive.Seems like this cross sedan might get increased exterior proportions when compared to the S60 sedan. Reports state that it will come with a length of 4635mm along with a width and height of 2097mm and 1484mm, respectively. Not only this, it is also likely to get 65mm more ground clearance, which makes it safer on uneven surfaces and bumpy roads. As for the design, this machine looks dapper in all its profiles. However, if we first take a look at its front facade, it is bold and beautiful with a large perforated grille featuring the prominent brand's logo in the center with chrome embellishment. On either side of the grille, we can notice the trendy headlight cluster, which will mostly be fitted with LED lights, and turn indicators. The sporty bumper might get the body colour and houses a wide air intake as well. Besides these, we can also see the stylish daytime running lights fitted just at the top of both the air ducts. Another attractive element in its front fascia is the sloping bonnet that looks simply great with some visible character lines over it. On the sides, it will probably feature black cladding on the wheel arches, which slightly bulge. It is speculated to come with both 18 and 19 inch wheels, which will be covered with high performance tubeless radial tyres. Apart from the B-pillars, even the wing mirrors might be painted in black with side turn blinkers integrated into them. Moving on to its rear, it looks like its tail section has been slightly increased, which adds to grace and elegance. We can notice the wide dimension of its windscreen that will mostly include a defogger. The boot lid with its brand name is quite appealing, whereas the tail light cluster gets a good design as well. Apart from this, the sharp design of its bumper will impress you, while the skid plate beneath it will further give it a rugged appearance.As of now, we do don\xe2\x80\x99t have any concrete information about its boot space. However, keep looking at this section for updates. InteriorAs Volvo has now put its focus on the crossover segment, we can certainly expect it to offer this particular model with the best of features that will appeal to the masses. This one will be a five seater with a plush and roomy cabin that might come with different attractive colour options to choose from. A few of its pictures reveal its insides, wherein, we can notice a well designed dashboard integrated with several advanced components. Whereas, the neat metal plating on some of the equipments further adds to its elegance. A power steering wheel is expected with tilt adjustment facility, and it might also come mounted with several switches for easy operation of other functions. And an advanced air conditioning unit will be on the offer, to create a pleasant ambiance while you are on the journey. As for the seats, we can anticipate getting front adjustable seats along with lumbar support probably for the driver, whereas the rear ones might receive folding function that will be useful for increasing boot space. Aspects such as auto-dimming inside mirrors, power windows, trip computer, electrically powered glass sunroof, and many storage spaces will be on offer. Besides these, nothing much has been revealed about its interiors, but it is rumored to carry most of the elements that are available in the existing S60 sedan. PerformancePresently, reports are doing rounds that the Volvo S60 Cross Country will be on the offer with two diesel engine options. In the international market, it is also available with a petrol drive train. So, this leaves us with a thought that it may also have a petrol version, but no such information is out yet. DieselAccording to reports, this cross sedan is said to have a 2.4-litre, D4 diesel engine that is likely to generate a maximum power of 180bhp. This might come with five cylinders and be based on the all-wheel drive mechanism. On the other hand, it might also be powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged oil burner and make an appearance with front wheel drive configuration. Both these motors are expected to be paired with a six speed automatic transmission gear box, which might deliver superior performance. Ride and HandlingAs of now, we have no information regarding the kind of suspension system it may be offered with. But, we are hoping it might have the same system as the current S60 model, which comes with front independent McPherson strut and the rear multi link system. In terms of braking, it will most likely have a robust set of disc brakes fitted to both its front and rear wheels. Besides these, a speed sensitive electric steering column might be on offer. This one gives you good control over the vehicle besides simplifying its maneuverability on any road condition.SafetySafety has always been a top priority in all the models offered by this brand. So, we are sure this upcoming vehicle too has many vital safety elements. This may be loaded with aspects like dynamic stability and traction control, tyre pressure monitoring system, safety belts with pretensioners and load limiters, and Voice On Call functions. Apart from these, it will also have airbags, whiplash protection system, immobilizer, automatic door locking and many such features which add to the passenger security. VariantsAccording to the information gathered so far, this model will be available in two variants with two different engine options. Except for the technical specifications, the features list might remain the same in both variants. VerdictVolvo is one such renowned brand, which has always impressed the masses through its vehicles in all aspects, be it the engine performance, advanced safety or the enhanced comfort. Even this yet-to-be-launched model seems quite promising with some interesting elements on the list. We are only hoping that the S60 Cross Country does well as good as the other successful vehicles from this brand, once it enters our market."

sS'Mahindra XUV500'
p37
S"Introduction:Mahindra is just the company that you can trust with a release such as this. The company currently stands on the shoulders of a portfolio of strong, well performed SUVs that have taken the market by storm. The XUV500 is probably the toughest and most majestic vehicle of the entire lot, and we're sure it's one of those vehicles that will be shaping the trend a long time after. It is needless to say, however, that the robust machine comes with the potential to disappoint just as much as it has to delight, and we're here to plunge into its every facet to find out where it scores and where it doesn't.Pros:1. Very large and spacious interiors, plenty of room in first two rows.2. Reliable engine performance in highways as well as city roads.3. Delhiites can now buy the model with a 1997cc engine under the hood.Cons:1. The lack of substantial luggage space is sure to hit buyers hard.2. The 3rd row seats are a little too cramped for adults to comfortably sit in.3. Mahindra lacks the premium after-sales service that customers might expect from other brands.Stand-out Features:1.The voice messaging system and the touch-screen Infotainment system capture just what the younger generation today want in a car.2. ABS, EBD, ESP and many other stability aids is sure to place the vehicle in an extremely good light.Overall:The XUV500 is the type of vehicle that casts a menacing aura around it, with a commanding exterior build the likes of which few road machines have seen before. Its impressive image is further refined with a well balanced alignment, a raw design theme and numerous fine highlights. Meanwhile, when you step into the interior, you're sure to feel a tingle of awe at the enormous, spacious cabin, which comes along with numerous comfort aids. The higher variants of the model series bring an edge of entertainment to your feet, with a Touchscreen Infotainment system, a voice messaging system, the Mahindra Blue Sense app and many more exciting features. Propulsion power for the drive comes from a mighty 2.2-litre mHawk diesel engine, which guarantees a strain-free and wholesome drive with the advent of strong disc brakes and a well reinforced chassis arrangement. Now, the XUV500 comes with a 2.0-litre under the hood (exclusive for Delhi) that churns out exactly the same power and torque like 2.2-litre mHawk mill.Exteriors:The large, muscular pose of the vehicle draws a really strong appeal over it, and we're know for one that younger viewers will absolutely love it. The company has also infused a delicate and feminine touch to the robust vehicle, with subtle body lines, chrome highlights and an agile, streamlined shape that is sure to get heads turning when on the street.When you look at the model from the front, you feel a powerful pulse emanate from it. The massive bonnet, large grille and the aesthetically designed skirts bring a bold look to the front, and this sets the tone for the entire vehicle's image.At the centre of the front is a large black grille with the company's marque engraved upon it, and you're sure to feel the adrenaline upon viewing the slim chrome highlights that blend into the black background perfectly. Stationed on either side of this are intricately designed headlamp clusters that come with all the lighting systems an average citizen would expect.The front skirts have been skilfully moulded, so that the fine cladding and the visible curves add to the strength of the front. By the corner of the bumper, the fog lamps have been touched with a chrome bezel applique, and although it's not wholly prominent, we enjoyed the refined atmosphere that the car was trying to build.The massive bonnet has been streaked with soft lines, and this is sure to satisfy the appetite of modern audiences. You catch a spark of true design ingenuity when you view the way the metallic skin of the bonnet streams into the side and builds around the thick, sturdy wheel arches.The muscular fenders add a more vitalised feel to the side profile, and that's just the type of thing audiences today like. The well structured alloy wheels bring another small visual treat to the casual eye, while at the top, the black roof rails invoke a slightly more functional image in our opinion.As we stood before the vehicle, it was clear to us that this company loves to add sizzle to its vehicle, and the chrome lining on the window does just that. The black coloured window frames help to diversify the look, together with the prominent cladding strips that sweep through the side.A glance at this machine is enough to fortify your impression of a well tailored, balanced vehicle. The rear portion is bulkier and wider than the front, allowing the roof to taper down gently towards the front, before sinking towards the bonnet. We've got to hand it to them; Mahindra has done a phenomenal job in polishing this machine up for a gritty and sporty edge. Despite being a large and hefty SUV, its streamlined and graceful profile does add racy elements to it.The large tailgate is flanked by vertical tail-lamps, while serene body lines cut in towards the centre. The chrome bezel highlight on the tailgate finishes off the entire picture with an neat and opulent look.Interiors:The cabin is spacious, and there would be little effort needed in hosting tall, burly and larger people within it. As you take a seat within the vehicle, you feel an aura that leans towards lavishness, but anyone would admit that it isn't near perfection.A tiny 'wow' factor emanates from the gizmos and the facilities hosted at the centre console, but you're sure to notice certain elements in the design that could use better quality. Nevertheless, we maintain that it's still a pretty sound offer considering its price, which is Rs.9 lakhs short of the Fortuner. The dual tone black and beige environment is an improvement from its earlier condition which, we thought was rather dry. The upper half of the dash is coloured in polished black, while the glove box and its surrounding area is beige. By the corners of the wide dashboard, you have vertically positioned AC vents, and we thought this evoked a more distinguished look for the place.At the top of the centre console is the Infotainment system with a touchscreen display and the controls at the bottom. Staged below this is the air conditioning system which comes along with rotary controls that we thought looked pretty classy.By the right hand side, the steering wheel has an eye catching design, and we thought it felt good to hold.The instrument cluster arrangement is perhaps the most stylish element of the entire cabin, with two bloated covers blanketing the tachometer and the speedometer.We had little to complain about in the seating arrangement, and it is clear that an ergonomic precision has guided this. The Beige colouring of the seats, we thought, was pretty holistic, and the leather upholstery also feels good. The presence of headrests and armrests for front row is sure to rake up your comfort level.The central armrest console of the front occupants comes along with a storage compartment that is cleverly tucked underneath.There is plenty of legroom for the front and second row, but we thought that the third row was best suited for children or smaller adults.Performance:The rugged machine gets an equally rugged engine-the mHawk140 diesel engine with a displacement of 2179cc. The power-plant is armed with a variable geometry turbocharger, and this definitely bolsters its performance capacity to a certain degree. The machine's specifications are reasonable, with a power of 140bhp at 3750rpm along with a torque of 330Nm at 1600rpm to 2800rpm. As you start the engine, you can sense a very minimal turbo lag. The drive quality on urban roads is fantastic, and the power-train drags the mighty machine gracefully through your every day streets. The power delivery is linear at all times, and sudden anomalies in the engine sound are remarkably rare. The 6-speed manual synchromesh gearbox is pretty easy to use. The first and the second gear come with a distinctly short gap, and this may be of good aid when you're rolling through traffic, for you'd rarely need to downshift in these close and messy times.Now, for the Delhiites, the XUV500 comes exclusively with a 1997cc diesel engine option that releases the same output as the 2.2-litre mHawk oil-burner. However, this mill comes with a 6-speed manual gearbox only. This comes in wake of Supreme Court's ban on diesel engines with a size of more than 2.0-litres. This new launch will now open the Delhi market for Mahindra.Ride and Handling:We thought that the chassis arrangement was very well tuned, keeping the ride smoother than you'd expect. In addition to this, the powerful construct and wide grounding of the vehicle also boosts stability during the ride. There was minimal body roll by SUV standards, but you'd need to keep yourself anchored when cornering. But linear drives are marvellous at speeds as high as 120kmph, and we couldn't help but get the feeling that the car had been fastened to the ground.The independent suspension arrangement does a good job, with a combination of a McPherson front axle and Multi-link type rear. Anti roll bars have been clipped onto both arms, helping to cement stability further. Meanwhile, disc and caliper type brakes do a great job of containing the car's speeds and bringing it to a stop, and this does add up to an even more excellent handling quality altogether.Safety:There are some strong safety shields for the occupants, including dual front airbags, together with side and curtain airbags as well. All variants come with ABS and EBD, while the higher end trims also get an electronic stability program that comes along with rollover mitigation. Peace of mind is also ensured with a hill hold and descent control, side impact beams, crumple zones that guard against crashes and tubeless radials that enhance control when driving.Variants:The model series comes in four variants, the W4, W6, W8 and W10. The entry level trim, the W4, has a limited list of features that includes a single row LCD display, projector headlamps, an electrically operated temperature control, tilt power steering, a twin pod instrument cluster, power windows and a remote tail-gate opener. Meanwhile W6 and W8 trims level up the comfort with some more features, such as an advanced Intellipark system, reading lamps, an entry assist lamp, and many more. Meanwhile, the top end trim, W10 has it all: illuminated scuff plates, a hill descent control, a remote central locking system, puddle lamps, a 7 inch touchscreen Infotainment system, a voice messaging system and an electronic steering lock. We'd say that the top end variant would satisfy you if you insist on high quality luxury, while the lower end trims would suit people who could compromise on comforts for a better price.Verdict:This is a vehicle that will have a strong appeal for a certain class of people. Its muscular exteriors, spacious and comfortable interiors and reliable handling place it well ahead of many competitors in the segment. On the downside, you'll have to put up with a minimal luggage carrying capacity, a more utilitarian cabin design, some cramped space in the third row and a performance that could be better. At the end of the day, you'll love this vehicle if you're out for a good look, a good drive and a decent price. If you're the type that wants a wider package, then some other model would best serve your interests."

It has presented its admirers with a fleet of cars that personify elegance and beauty, smashed together with the finest performance possible. Standing tall across the span of nearly a hundred years, this is a giant in the world of cars, a name that has been engraved in history to stand not only for the length of time that it exists, but well beyond.

The car stands tall and wide, with a robust, hefty build that invokes the menace of many other mighty giants such as Hummer. It is known that Bentley has invested a great amount of time, money and personnel on the working of this brand new masterpiece, which is sure to leave its thumb-print in the realm of SUVs and luxury crossovers. As far as the images on the interweb confirm, the machine is up-to-date on all fundamental and conventional features that Bentley's cars have sought to bring. It has been manufactured on a rat-race with sizzling competition with numerous other towering brands and companies. The Rolls Royce is also planning to bring out its very first SUV, and Bentley has beaten the odds to get there first. The Bentayga is a marvel from this manufacturer, a blend of good looks, elegance and class, but at the same time, nothing left compromised with performance and other heavier features.\n\nIt is seen with an architectural layout that gathers the most immense appeal. It is equipped with the same well bound body format that most top end SUV brands give their vehicles. The exterior structure of the vehicle is very much similar to the build of other machines of this segment such as the Hummer range. It is tall and lanky, with a robust body format to weather rougher terrain. It is speculated that the basis of this car would be harsher and more unpredictable off-the-road conditions, which is the reason behind its broad and well structured build. The side profile is accentuated with large fenders and broad wheels that are sure to grip the sand dunes when treading on them. The front is adorned with the conventional Bentley grille, complete with Continental style quad circular headlamps. The broad and rectangular headlamps are aided with the presence of smaller lights below it, and air vents positioned in between the entire frontage for maximum cooling to the large engine.

In addition to fulfilled gadgetry and high class upholstery, the vehicle must have the finest atmosphere, and this is enabled with a top grade air conditioning with ducts positioned all over for strategic circulation.\n\nAll brought together, the strong external cover and the blessed internal design together bring this vehicle to the edge that Bentley has always pushed towards.

It is supposedly to be fired by an engine that dazzles with power like very few others have. A high powered 6.0-litre W12 engine is said to be hosting the speed requirements of the car, and this is by no means an ordinary drivetrain. Although it is not confirmed, these are speculative adjustments, and another one is nothing close to awesome as well. A 4.0-litre twin turbo V8 engine is another choice of engine that it seems the car will have, and both of these engines together meant to leave the roads trembling wherever this machine passes. It is rumored that this will be build on a chassis system based on that of the Audi Q5, and this is probably one of the best qualities one could expect of it, in terms of performance and control. It is built on a technology that guarantees a mix of both on-road and off-the-road performance. The machine ensures that the needs of the road are geared up for, with techno systems to enhance ride pleasure and safety, like all of Bentley's extraordinary machines have.\n\nFurthermore, the Bentayga is sure to be armed with the gift of precision with technology as well, with all the technologically advanced features that vehicles of this company have had, from ABS and EBD to airbags and other stuff. This machine is a one of a kind innovation, something that is sure to raise Bentley and its manufacturing base to a whole new grounding in the industry.

sS'Ferrari California T'
p43
S'Ferrari 458 Speciale, the most extreme road-legal from Ferrari has been unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show September this year. If we watch it from a naked eye, it appears nothing more than a regular 458 but the content hidden underneath says the whole story making this supercar truly worthy of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeciale\xe2\x80\x9d insignia. The new model from Ferrari is innovation to new active aerodynamic and traction modification technologies to make it the fastest and capable Ferrari roadster to grace a track. It sports very interesting specs under the hood retaining the same but slightly tuned 4.5L V-8 powertrain from the base 458 Italia. It generates massive power of 596hp and 540Nm of torque. However the torque value remains the same as in the base 458, its horsepower has been increased by 34hp. Ferrari has been claiming this as the highest figure ever achieved by a naturally aspirated road car engine which edges it closer to its opponent McLaren 12c (616bhp). The engine is coupled with a seven-speed F1 dual clutch paddle-shift transmission gearbox. This great combination allows this beast to achieve 100kmph in mere 3 seconds of time reaching the top speed of 325kmph which Ferrari claims the highest lateral acceleration in any of its roadsters. This supercar also features a new Side Slip Angle Control System that instantly senses oversteering and automatically manages torque delivery and distribution via Formula 1-Trac traction control and E-Diff electronic differential. The advance combination of tailored Michelin Pilot Sport Cup2 tyres helps in improving balance and traction. The braking system has also been upgraded with the introduction of new calipers inspired from LaFerrari. Not only this, Ferrari 458 Speciale also shows its improved emission ratings with 275g CO2/km against 307g CO2/km in 458 coupe. The first and foremost thing that to be noticed in this cranked-up 458 Speciale is its graceful red paint job and combination of blue and white stripes lying on it giving it a stunning look. Front fascia of the car has been given much treatment with more sculptured bonnet giving more room for ventilation. It now features a reverse-vented hood which permits free air flow and help reduce drag. Rear has striking similarity to the racecar with larger diffuser and dual integrated exhaust pipes replacing the standard 458\xe2\x80\x99s trio tailpipes. Ferrari in its latest offering has installed a heavily tailored front skirt which it has named \xe2\x80\x9cmoveable aerodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d that increases downforce and help in lower dragging. As per other aerodynamic enhancing mods, they can be seen easily seen as on the outer edges of the front clothing, a wide opening and reverse-vented hood. In addition to this, Ferrari also reduced this supercar\xe2\x80\x99s weight to 1290kg from stock weight of 1380kg. The interiors of the car follow the architecture of Italia with a few elegant and purposeful modifications. Sabelt racer seats are affixed featuring standard carbon-fiber shells with presence of Alcantara. The glovebox and carpets have been omitted. The steering wheel inside are perfectly carved holding loads of buttons without any ordinary audio and cruise controlling functions. The lower right of the car, there is housed in a carbon fiber insert, the red Manetinno commutator switch that controls all five performance settings. The lower left holds Scarlet engine start key, when pushed coughs to life like a challenging monster clearing the throat after waking from a deep sleep. As far as instrument cluster is concerned, it has received a yellow-face treatment displaying \xe2\x80\x9c458 Speciale\xe2\x80\x9d on the screen. Ferrari claims that some of the first time introduced innovative features will make way for its future road cars to come with SSC and active aerodynamic dead certs. The core engineering philosophy revolves around pushing the cover with each new model and at the same time maintaining the inherent chassis balance and handling, ensuring that even amateur can get maximum driving pleasure. As far as competition is concerned, the newest addition from Ferrari will lock horns with Lamborghini Gallardo Squadra Corse 2013. As for now, unfortunately the model presented by Ferrari is a concept model to show off future technology to its potential buyers, so we are not expecting this prancing horse hitting our showrooms soon. But it is sure that Ferrari will release Speciale\xe2\x80\x99s price and production number soon and it is expected to bear a price tag of around US$ 400,000 (INR. 25204800.00).'

sS'BMW 1 Series'
p45
S"BMW 1 Series is the least expensive model in the company's portfolio, but still, it hasn't lived upto the expectations. Even after having an intuitive list of features under its belly, it turned out to be a slow-selling product for the manufacturer. Now, in a move to spur its sales, the car maker has introduced its facelift version in the country. Available only in one 118d Sport Line trim, this vehicle comes equipped with a 2.0-litre diesel engine. Earlier this year at the Geneva Motor Show, this facelift version was displayed to the enthusiasts and now, it has silently made its entry into the Indian shores. As compared to its predecessor, it has slightly grown taller and longer making room for more space inside the cabin. As for the changes outside, it gets a new set of headlights and a pronounced radiator grille enhancing its overall sporty silhouette. Its side facet remains identical to its previous model, but the rear gets 'L' shaped taillights. Additionally, the rear bumper now features dual exhaust pipes. Coming to the insides, the design remains the same, but the use of updated upholstery and metallic accents brings a refreshing new look to the cabin.\n\nThe manufacturer is offering it a dual-zone automatic climate control as a standard feature. This vehicle also gets an updated iDrive infotainment system with a 6.5-inch high resolution display as standard. Apart from this, all the other features of this hatchback have been retained. This version of the 1 Series gets Sport Line styling package as standard, which redefines its class and elegance. The elements included in this pack includes high gloss black kidney grille with 8-slats, entry sills with BMW designation, tailpipes in black chrome and sport leather wrapped steering wheel. This is the hatchback packed with state-of-the-art features like an intelligent energy management system. This is a function that collaborates with automatic start/stop function, steering wheel and brake energy regeneration to ensure maximum performance and sustainable mobility. Also present in this car is the driver assistance package that comprises of camera-based functions like approach control, departure warning and person warning. This intelligent technology operates in step and applies brakes in the event of an emergency. With such hi-tech features and improved cosmetics, this series will give a tough fight against the likes of Mercedes Benz A Class and Volvo V40.Coming to the exterior design, this latest version flaunts its refreshing looks with a new set of cosmetics. On the front facade, we can see the redesigned headlight cluster with all-LED lighting. In the center, the kidney bean shaped grille also received an updated and is garnished in high gloss black. The beauty of its front facade is elevated by the company's logo on top of the hood. Below this grille, the body colored bumper gets a new design with two air ducts and a bigger air dam. Round shaped fog lamps can be seen over the air ducts with sleek chrome strips. Additionally, the lower section of the bumper is fitted with a high-gloss black protection guard rendering a sporty appeal to the frontage. Side profile remains largely similar to the outgoing model, but there is an update with regards to its wheels. Its fenders are now fitted with 'Star-Spoke' styled alloy wheels embodying company's logo in the center. Door handles remain in body color, but the external rear view mirrors have been garnished in glossy black. They are further integrated with turn indicators along with mirror heating and memory function. Complimenting these mirrors are the window sills and B pillars, which are also done up in black. The rear section also gets some new cosmetics in the form of 'L' shaped tail lights. The tailgate and the windscreen didn't get any update, but the bumper gets a new look with dual exhaust pipes in black chrome. Its increased length and height are another factor that makes this hatchback look superior than others in its class.\n\nExterior Measurements:\n\nAs specified above, this hatchback has grown bigger in its size. It now has an overall length measuring 4329mm and a height standing at 1440mm. Its total width including the outside mirrors measures at 1984mm. Now, it also has a longer wheelbase of 2690mm, which indicates an improvement in its cabin space.Ed's Take: The 1 Series has good quality interiors however it is a bit too dull and boring styling. Other competitors are much more stylish and contemporary.Although the cabin design remains the same, the updated upholstery and metallic accents render a rejuvenating appeal to the interiors. The space inside the cabin has also gone up with better head and leg room. This eventually offers better comfort and convenience than its predecessors.

In the mean time, this hatch takes only about 8.1 seconds to clock 100 Kmph mark from a standstill.Ed's Take: BMW has always had Efficient Dynamics, and the 1 Series isn\xe2\x80\x99t any different. The BMW 1 Series diesel is definitely the pick of the mill.Currently, there is only one variant that this 1 Series hatchback comes in. It is powered by a 2.0-litre diesel engine, which comprises of 4-cylinders. Integrated with this motor is a twin-power turbocharger that spurs up its overall output. Besides, the common rail fuel injection technology is another reason why it is so efficient. Having a displacement capacity of 1995cc, this mill can churn out a maximum power of 148bhp at 4000rpm that results in a maximum torque output of 320Nm in the range of 1500 to 3000rpm.

This enables 50:50 load distribution and contributes for better comfort to the occupants.Ed's Take: The fuel efficiency of the diesel 1 Series is good, it increases with the new eight-speed transmission and other features like ECO PRO and regenerative braking.As against the previous model, this 2015 version is now available only in one variant with av diesel engine option. It is a 4-cylindered mill with a total displacement capacity of 1995cc. Being a bigger and powerful engine, one would expect it to deliver a low mileage, but surprisingly, it produces 23.26 Kmpl.Ed's Take: The power produced by the 1 Series diesel is more than the petrol. The power might sound less, but for a hatchback and a eight speed transmission its more than sufficient.This 2.0-litre oil-burner comprises of a twin-power turbocharger for enhanced power generation and optimum performance. This allows it to unleash a maximum power of 148bhp that results in a hammering torque of 320Nm.Ed's Take: The 1Series comes loaded with several frills and one can also customise the 1 Series like any other BMW that is currently available in the market.Like any other BMW vehicle, this model too comes with several BMW ConnectDrive functions including specialized applications.

Those include durable all-weather floor mats, BMW urban key case, luggage compartment mats, body decals and alloy wheels.Ed's Take: BMW has always had strong driving dynamics characteristics and the 1 Series is no different. The steering feel is also amazing.This is one department, where BMW has never compromised with any of its models. Like other company's products, this 1 Series hatchback too comes with disc brakes fitted to all its four wheels. They are assisted by anti lock braking and cornering brake control. Additionally, brake assist function further augments the mechanism, irrespective of the conditions. A few other functions like dynamic stability control including traction control programs have also integrated for improving the stability. This hatchback also has an advanced servotronic steering assistance that uses the power generated with the help of brake energy regeneration technology. However, the response it offers is precise, which is important for handling any car. On the other hand, its suspension system is something that can take it all the jerks caused on roads enabling optimum comforts to the occupants inside.Ed's Take: The 1 Series has multiple airbags, ESP and ABS to protect you from any crashes that happen.Coming to the crucial safety section, this model series has a total of six airbags for front passengers that helps to reduce the risk of injury in case of an accident.

Fuel economy is far better than others.\n\n4. Interior space got better for more comfort.\n\n5. Safety standards are at par with others.1. Low ground clearance is a minus point.\n\n2. There is no rear view camera.\n\n3. More updates can be given to its side profile.\n\n4. iDrive with touch controller could be given as standard.\n\n5. Lack of navigation is a disadvantage."

sS'Ford Figo'
p55
S'IntroductionThe Figo enters it\xe2\x80\x99s second generation, taking over the reins from what was Ford\xe2\x80\x99s most successful hatch in the country. The 2015 iteration is more powerful, safer and looks as modern as it should. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a quick look at what the little Ford has to offer.Pros1. Proportions. Just the right size for the city. 2. 100 PS Diesel engine is frugal as well as fun to drive. 3. Safety - dual airbags standard, 6 airbags on the top-specCons1. Petrol motor lacks punch. Strictly an intra-city runabout.2. Interior quality isn\xe2\x80\x99t the best, feels flimsy. Rivals like the Grand i10 have much better interiors.3. Automatic not offered in the top-spec variant, thus misses out on some good-to-have features.Stand Out Features1.Ford MyKey : Programmable second key to set a speed limit; volume limit. Unique to the Figo. Useful when you want to hand the car to someone who\xe2\x80\x99s just learnt how to drive. 2.Six-airbags is a segment benchmark. Unheard of in a sub 10 lakh rupee hatchback.ExteriorThe older Figo was termed \xe2\x80\x98boring\xe2\x80\x99 by the majority, purely because of the way it was styled. This one however, isn\xe2\x80\x99t boring in any sense of the word. The front gets large swept-back headlamps and a gaping grille that might remind you of certain Aston Martins. The foglamps are tucked away on the lower half of the bumper, but they look a size smaller than what would have suited the Ford.The side sees a distinct shoulder line running across the length of the car and a large window area. The window line swoops up as it passes the rear door and ends into a rather thick C-pillar. The turn indicators are placed neatly on the wing mirrors, which is a neat touch. The only aspect that let\xe2\x80\x99s the design of the Figo down, have to be the puny 14 inch alloys. The hatch could\xe2\x80\x99ve definitely done with a bigger and better set of wheels. The large bumper takes up most of the real-estate at the rear. It is minimalistic to say the least. The reverse lamps, rear fog lights are integrated into the tail-light assembly itself which ends up freeing a lot of space on the rear end. It could\xe2\x80\x99ve done with a pair of reflectors on the bumper to break up the bulk.Dimension wise, the Ford is the largest car in its class. It also gets the largest wheelbase. Surprisingly, the ground clearance is better than the \xe2\x80\x98micro SUV\xe2\x80\x99 aka KUV1OO.The Figo won\xe2\x80\x99t be winning any design awards. At the same time, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t draw polarising opinions either. It is available in seven different colors and has the right mix of straights & curves. We can say that Ford has definitely played it\xe2\x80\x99s design cards safe.InteriorAmongst the first things you notice is how the low the car is. Elderly folks will most definitely have a problem getting used to the low slung seating. The interior is a very familiar place to be, especially if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in a Ford recently. The Figo ditches the black and beige theme that the Aspire carries for a cleaner all black layout. There\xe2\x80\x99s a splatter of silver on the centre console and some chrome around the AC vents to break the monotony of black. The seats are upholstered in good quality fabric. Although we would have loved to see leather interiors from the Aspire, the Figo does just enough to justify it\xe2\x80\x99s price. The front seats are a nice place to be - they are really supportive. That said, a little more cushioning wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have hurt. The driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat gets adjust for height as well as reach, whereas the steering can be adjusted only for the tilt. Inspite of the lack of reach adjust on the steering wheel, getting into a comfortable driving position isn\xe2\x80\x99t too much of a task. The rear bench is flat, and could certainly do with a little more cushioning as well. The seats will accommodate  2 people at best, the 3rd passenger will be a bit of a squeeze for the Ford. Lastly, unlike the Grand i10, the Ford misses out on rear ac vents and a central armrest, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a major deal-breaker. The top-spec Titanium+ variant of the Figo comes all that you could ask for in a hatch from this segment. It gets automatic climate control, which is an absolute boon in the sweltering heat that our country is known for. It also gets a button that is marked MAX A/C that chills the cabin down very quickly. Talking of entertainment, the Figo gets an integrated music system with bluetooth, AUX and USB connectivity as well. It also gets Ford\xe2\x80\x99s SYNC system that lets you use voice commands to place a call or play music. The steering, is borrowed from the Ecosport and houses buttons for the telephony and the calls. It has a grainy texture which lets the driver have a firm grip. However, the steering is a bit too light by Ford standards - more on that later. If you opt for the Titanium variant; you will miss out on the screen for the system and Ford\xe2\x80\x99s SYNC system. In place, you get a dock for your phone instead. The arrangement, dubbed MyDock is a super-convenient place to dock the phone while playing music or using navigation on the device. The Figo offers all that you need in a hatch from this segment. It has enough space for seating four, a lot of cubby holes around the cabin for the knick knacks and gets a fairly large 257 litre boot for the luggage. The only flaw has to be the build quality, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t as plush as the Grand i10 or even the Bolt for that matter. Overlook that, and the Figo is amongst the most cleverly packaged hatchbacks in the market today.Engine and PerformanceThe Ford Figo is available with a choice of two petrol engines and one diesel. While the large petrol engine is available only with a 6-speed dual clutch automatic gearbox, the other two engines come mated to a five speed manual gearbox.1.2 litre Ti-VCTThe 1.2 litre petrol engine, is best suited for the city. Out on the highways it definitely lacks punch. The motor needs to be revved really hard since the meat of the power is at the top of the rev range. Another peculiar thing we noticed was how audible the engine was at high revs. When driven sedately, it does return decent fuel economy. It is nothing more than a commuter class engine, that does it\xe2\x80\x99s duty well. The benchmark petrol engine in the segment, continues to be the 1.2 litre K-Series motor harbored in the Swift\xe2\x80\x99s engine bay. 1.5 litre Ti-VCTThis engine is available only with the 6 - speed dual clutch automatic transmission, in the Titanium trim. While it might make the Figo look like a hot hatch on paper, the 1.5 Ti-VCT fails to deliver on counts of performance. There just isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough torque for the gearbox to exploit and deliver. Where the engine and gearbox combo do score however, is in terms of sheer convenience. When driven with a light foot, the automatic keeps the wallet happy too. The engine and gearbox combo is definitely miles better than the only other petrol automatic in the segment - the Hyundai Grand i10.1.5 litre TDCiThe diesel engine is the one to pick if you enjoy driving. The 100PS power figure, coupled with the light body and compact proportions make it quite the pocket rocket. Low end torque is impressive and the engine pulls cleanly as the revvs climb. Issues with this engine remain the NVH levels inside the cabin, but that is a something that can be overlooked due to the immense potential the engine possesses. The diesel Figo is amongst the rare cars that can be fun and frugal at the same timeRide and HandlingThe suspension is noticeably softer than the Swift. The suspension is tuned for comfort which lets the Ford soak in the bumps easily. That said, the rear passengers get thrown about quite a bit over broken roads. The electronic power steering is almost too light by Ford standards. Compared to the old gen Figo\xe2\x80\x99s hydraulic unit - this one fails to deliver in terms of feel and feedback. While it is an absolute boon in bumper-to-bumper traffic, but can be slightly unnerving whilst doing triple digit speeds on the highway. Throw the Figo into a fast corner and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t upset. However, we would recommend getting some fat rubber before doing so. The stock tyre profile does not do much in terms of grip. Braking duties are handled by disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear. The Figo holds it\xe2\x80\x99s line under harsh braking. Also, pedal feedback is very good. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any issues with the brakes even after multiple rounds of testing. VariantsThe Figo is offered in a total of 5 variants. The base variant is a no-frills hatch which has essentials such as air-conditioning covered. The Ambiente version gets Dual Airbags as standard. It also gets a passenger side mirror, front power windows and silver detailing on the grille. If you are on an absolute budget, pick the Ambiente since it has a basic safety net in place. The trend variant gets some convenience features like remote unlock and a four-speaker audio system with steering mounted controls. It also gets indicators on the wing-mirrors and all four power windows. The Titanium spec sees the Figo get front foglamps, rear defogger and climate control. Most importantly, it gets ABS with EBD. The top-spec Titanium+ variant is full loaded, getting goodies such as a side and curtain airbags, a 4.2 inch screen for the music system and voice command as well.SafetyOn the safety front, the Figo is the only hatch to get six - airbags in the top-spec Titanium+ Variant. Dual airbags are standard across the range. It also gets ABS with EBD; and with the Automatic the Ford is equipped with Hill Launch Assist and ESP as well. VerdictThe Ford Figo makes for a nice city commuter. In different guises, it offers convenience, frugality and is fun to drive too. There are certain inconsistencies in quality both on the inside and out; but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a deal breaker in any manner whatsoever. The Figo is a well - rounded hatch for the city. The petrol engines are refined and will lap up the city commutes with ease. If \xe2\x80\x98Fun To Drive\xe2\x80\x99 is a must-have on your checklist for the next car, the diesel is the one for you.  Overall, the Figo comes across as a really competitive alternative to the Grand i10, Bolt and the Swift.'

The new model from Ferrari is innovation to new active aerodynamic and traction modification technologies to make it the fastest and capable Ferrari roadster to grace a track. It sports very interesting specs under the hood retaining the same but slightly tuned 4.5L V-8 powertrain from the base 458 Italia. It generates massive power of 596hp and 540Nm of torque. However the torque value remains the same as in the base 458, its horsepower has been increased by 34hp. Ferrari has been claiming this as the highest figure ever achieved by a naturally aspirated road car engine which edges it closer to its opponent McLaren 12c (616bhp). The engine is coupled with a seven-speed F1 dual clutch paddle-shift transmission gearbox. This great combination allows this beast to achieve 100kmph in mere 3 seconds of time reaching the top speed of 325kmph which Ferrari claims the highest lateral acceleration in any of its roadsters. This supercar also features a new Side Slip Angle Control System that instantly senses oversteering and automatically manages torque delivery and distribution via Formula 1-Trac traction control and E-Diff electronic differential. The advance combination of tailored Michelin Pilot Sport Cup2 tyres helps in improving balance and traction. The braking system has also been upgraded with the introduction of new calipers inspired from LaFerrari. Not only this, Ferrari 458 Speciale also shows its improved emission ratings with 275g CO2/km against 307g CO2/km in 458 coupe. The first and foremost thing that to be noticed in this cranked-up 458 Speciale is its graceful red paint job and combination of blue and white stripes lying on it giving it a stunning look. Front fascia of the car has been given much treatment with more sculptured bonnet giving more room for ventilation. It now features a reverse-vented hood which permits free air flow and help reduce drag. Rear has striking similarity to the racecar with larger diffuser and dual integrated exhaust pipes replacing the standard 458\xe2\x80\x99s trio tailpipes. Ferrari in its latest offering has installed a heavily tailored front skirt which it has named \xe2\x80\x9cmoveable aerodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d that increases downforce and help in lower dragging. As per other aerodynamic enhancing mods, they can be seen easily seen as on the outer edges of the front clothing, a wide opening and reverse-vented hood. In addition to this, Ferrari also reduced this supercar\xe2\x80\x99s weight to 1290kg from stock weight of 1380kg. The interiors of the car follow the architecture of Italia with a few elegant and purposeful modifications. Sabelt racer seats are affixed featuring standard carbon-fiber shells with presence of Alcantara. The glovebox and carpets have been omitted. The steering wheel inside are perfectly carved holding loads of buttons without any ordinary audio and cruise controlling functions. The lower right of the car, there is housed in a carbon fiber insert, the red Manetinno commutator switch that controls all five performance settings. The lower left holds Scarlet engine start key, when pushed coughs to life like a challenging monster clearing the throat after waking from a deep sleep. As far as instrument cluster is concerned, it has received a yellow-face treatment displaying \xe2\x80\x9c458 Speciale\xe2\x80\x9d on the screen. Ferrari claims that some of the first time introduced innovative features will make way for its future road cars to come with SSC and active aerodynamic dead certs. The core engineering philosophy revolves around pushing the cover with each new model and at the same time maintaining the inherent chassis balance and handling, ensuring that even amateur can get maximum driving pleasure. As far as competition is concerned, the newest addition from Ferrari will lock horns with Lamborghini Gallardo Squadra Corse 2013. As for now, unfortunately the model presented by Ferrari is a concept model to show off future technology to its potential buyers, so we are not expecting this prancing horse hitting our showrooms soon. But it is sure that Ferrari will release Speciale\xe2\x80\x99s price and production number soon and it is expected to bear a price tag of around US$ 400,000 (INR. 25204800.00).'

sS'Mercedes-Benz E-Class'

S"Introduction:Mercedes-Benz is one of the most acclaimed car makers in the world, and this auto giant has been successful in making its mark in Indian terrain as well. With the launch of the E-Class, the company goes one notch up in its hold of the luxury saloon market. We thought that this car had just about everything, from the exotic look to the most refined interiors and a broad list of features. However, there are things that every model lacks in, and we're here to dig through the vehicle to see what those are.Pros:1. Lavish interior environment that is sure to appeal to modern audiences.2. Advanced comfort and entertainment features that makes the ride all the more enjoyable.Cons:1. Its price is sure to deter many buyers.2. Ground clearance is weak.Stand-Out Features:1. A broad host of safety aids make the ride peaceful, secure and enjoyable, and we thought this was its strongest element.Overall:E-class is the saloon that has been waiting to set out on our streets. In its latest avatar, the vehicle boasts a whole new set of features, and a far more refreshed cabin that would amuse the masses. The exterior of the machine has been done up in a rich and prolific manner, and we thought there were influences of other models from the company in the design. The car comes with both petrol and engine alternatives, with a 2.1-litre diesel engine and a 2.0-litre petrol engine, both the motors are built to provide decent performance. Exteriors:The vehicle does make a daring statement, with its luxurious body format that is also specialised for a racy edge. We thought that balanced body dimensions, a low profile and a more agile posture helped to hone its look. Meanwhile, plush design themes enrich the overall appeal, so that when you stand before the machine, you feel a rather distinct allure that draws you towards it. The front is animated by the massive grille with the star emblem by the centre. The silver highlights by the grille make for a more energetic poise, along with the thin headlamps that bulge outwards into the side profile. The skin of the front flows down, sculpting the three part air dams that add some vigour to the image. The large bonnet extends over a large area, improving the masculine dimension of the machine. The gentle creases on the hood were excellent, and we thought that they underlined the machine's flawless build character. The bonnet gently rises up towards the windscreen, before melding into it. The wheel arches by the side have been given a more distinct impression, wrapping over perfectly crafted wheel rims that are sure to get people delighted. We noticed black highlights on the window frames, and this did invoke a more unique sense of vitality for the image. The overall structure has been perfected with a heavier rear portion, ensuring a sense of symmetry and harmony in the shape that gives the vehicle its glamour. Gentle body lines surf the door-sides, merging at the rear.The exhaust pipes by the corner of the bottom awakens a sportier side of the vehicle that we thought blends perfectly with the image. The curtly designed tail-lamps are positioned outside of the tail-gate, which is embellished with a chrome strip for a more lavish reflection. Interiors:There is a heavy theme of lavishness that runs over the cabin, and we know for one that this is the ideal car for luxury seekers. The leather dressing, the wooden inlays, chrome highlights and many more plush themes interact to bring forth a visually powerful layout for the place. At the front, the dashboard has been split into two portions, with the upper region hosting the large TFT 14.7cm colour display at the centre, along with two AC vents by the corner. The lower half of the dash comes with three AC vents spread right below. We loved the way the centre console slides down gently, merging into the gear shifter region in an expensive finish. The steering wheel comes with the standard Mercedes design, and we thought that there was a bold effect with the large star emblem at the centre. The seating arrangement was just as good as anyone would expect it to be, with the most uncompromising support for the passengers' well being. Lumbar support, electrical adjustment, along with headrests and many other facilities together make the ride just as cosy as it can get. Legroom is great on both rows, and we're sure that people of all sizes would have an enjoyable experience in here. The rich leather dressing further enhances the grand treatment, keeping all aspects of the ride at their peak. Performance:Diesel:Available with diesel as well as petrol engine options, the machine comes with a 2.1-litre diesel engine that comprises of 4 in-line cylinders. The company has modelled the power-train with some advanced technologies, ensuring that the running efficiency is kept at its optimum. This includes a new generation, common rail fuel injection system, powerful combustion chambers and precisely controlled piezo injectors. We thought that the specs levelled onto a decent plane, with 201bhp of power along with 500Nm of torque. It displaces a healthy 2143cc, going far ahead of many segment rivals. The engine's power is funnelled through a 7-speed automatic transmission, and the driver couldn't feel more relaxed and will love the overall ride experience. Petrol:On the petrol front, there is a 2.0-litre petrol mill that displaces 1991cc. It comes with 4 in-line cylinders, along with variable valve control and a turbocharger for the best working standard. The direct fuel injection system ensures smooth fuel transfer. It falls behind considerably with the specifications, with a power of 180bhp and a torque of 300Nm. Like for its diesel counterpart, the engine has been geared with a 7-speed automatic gearbox. Ride and Handling:It's no surprise that this company has mastered the art of providing a comfortable, pleasant ride, and passengers would find a hard time finding things to complain about. We thought that the overall ride was steady and smooth, with mere whiskers of unease in rare cases. Nevertheless, you're sure to feel blanketed in cosiness rarely found in home-made cars of domestic brands. The car has been programmed with a DIRECT CONTROL suspension arrangement. A selective damping facility further enhances the ride quality, ensuring that the passengers are kept comfortable, while at the same time, ensuring strong stability. Shock absorbers have been coupled onto the chassis as well, helping to swallow road anomalies without deterring the ride flow. We were also amazed at the Machine\xe2\x80\x99s responsive steering, which relieves a lot of strain for the driver. The car boasts a direct steering system that brings a more direct steering ratio, giving sharper agility and cornering power for the vehicle. Safety:The list of safety facilities seems never ending. The company seems to have left no stone unturned in bringing the firmest shield of security for the occupants. The passengers are kept well guarded with a system of eight airbags, which includes dual front airbags, side airbags, pelvis airbags and window airbags as well. Apart from this, a whole basket of crucial safety aids ensure that the ride quality is kept preserved, and this includes the Anti lock braking system, Acceleration skid control, Brake assist, Active parking assist and Electronic stability program.  An adaptive high beam assist ensures strong visibility when driving, along with an intelligent lighting system.Variants:There are three variants for the model, the E200, the E250CDI and the E350CDI. The majority of the features are shared by all of the models, and the differences come with regard to the drive system and the engine. All of the variants come along with full LED headlamps, an electric sunroof, a digital speedometer, a trip computer in the multi-function display, an Eco start/stop function, a tyre pressure loss warning system, rain sensing intermittent wipers, a central locking system. However, the E200 and E250CDI trims come with some specific features, including a 14.7cm TFT colour display, a 6 CD charger, a USB function, Bluetooth connectivity and an Infotainment system. The E350CDI, on the other hand, has a Harmon Kardon Logic 7 surround sound system, a media interface, a 360 degree camera, and a navigation system. Verdict:This is definitely a one of a kind vehicle, but we know for one that it would go only with a particular niche of people. It brims with luxury, comfort and lavish delights of the most expensive sort, while at the same time, giving passengers a decent width of all other aspects as well. On the downside, however, there is the hefty price and it is not the most fuel efficient machine as well. At the end, we'd say that this is the car for luxury loving customers who would be willing to go the extra mile for the right drive experience. For people looking for a regular car with a smaller budget, some other car would be suitable for you. "

S"Ford Mustang has always been the iconic car of America and will be so in the future. This pony car was first launched in the year 1965 and it has never looked back ever since. It has passed through decades and now it is in its sixth generation with an all new look, performance and features. However, the exciting part is that the manufacturer is considering the feasibility of launching this iconic car for the Indian automobile enthusiasts. There is no confirmed information yet relating to this vehicle but, there are many experts, who believe that this super car is going to be launched in the country's emerging car bazaar. The manufacturer has already started testing the right-hand drive version of this vehicle, which adds fuel to the speculations of its launch in the country. Currently, the manufacturer is offering the 2015 version of Mustang in a few markets across the globe and the same version is expected in India as well. Unlike its predecessor, this latest version looks quite stunning with more aggressive cues on its front facade. As you can see in the images, the headlight cluster has an extremely sleek structure with black finish and is housed with projector headlamps. The finish on bonnet too gets some improvement with flawless lines that adds to its masculine stance. However, the most attractive aspect of this vehicle will remain to be its radiator grille that is embodied with iconic brand's logo. As far as interiors are concerned, this vehicle has a classy internal cabin that is done up with all black color scheme. However, buyers have the option to personalize its cabin with a color scheme of their own choice.\n\nThis two door version is made to accommodate at least four occupants with two individual front seats and a rear bench seat. Unlike in the overseas markets, in India, it might be introduced with several safety and comfort features as standard. One can expect for standard comfort features like electronic temperature control, Mustang Dashboard, an advanced infotainment system with SYNC 2 connectivity feature. In terms of safety, features like powerful braking system, airbags and anti-theft protection package are most likely to be fitted in this vehicle. In the European markets, it is currently available in two variants. It is most likely that the manufacturer will introduce these two variants in India considering feasibility of shipping and customer demand. Among those, its entry level trim is powered by a high performance 2.3-litre EcoBoost engine, whereas the top end trim is powered by a V8, EcoBoost petrol motor. However, it is highly unlikely that the vehicle will be introduced as a CKD version, since it requires special manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure to meet the quality norms. At the same time, one can expect for the same on-road capabilities and driving dynamics like it has in the European markets. But right now, it is too early to say anything related to this vehicle as the manufacturer has not confirmed anything related to its launch.It is most likely that the manufacturer might introduce the recently unveiled 2015 version of Ford Mustang in India, which looks much aggressive than its earlier version. If this is the case, then auto enthusiasts in the country will be getting more than what they have expected for. This latest version carry forwards the iconic design language of the company that inspired many designers across the segment. It has the trademark radiator grille featuring a black colored perforated mesh, which is embedded with the model's badge. However, its headlight cluster of this latest version gone sleeker with clear lens design and black tinted finish inside. It is further housed with an elegant lighting pattern featuring projector headlamps along with turn indicators. The front bumper is rugged as usual with improved design featuring a black colored bumper lip. It houses a pair of fog lamps that further enhances the visibility in foggy condition. Coming to the side facet, this vehicle has a sleek profile with well carved fenders and expressively sculptured shoulder lines. Its wheel arches are going to be fitted with alloy wheels, but it is too early to specify the size of those rims. This two door version also has sleek window frames with black finish, while the door handles and ORVM caps are done up in body color. The rear facet is another attractive aspect of this pony car, thanks to the elegant taillight design and high gloss black accents on its tailgate. Unlike the front bumper, its rear one is extremely large, which is housed with a license plate console along with a pair of reflectors and other add-ons. It is also fitted with a body colored lower cladding along with a pair of black tinted exhaust pipes.\n\nExterior Measurements:\n\nConsidering the fact that the company may launch it as a CKD version, we can expect it to have the same exterior dimensions like its international version. If so, it is going to have a total length of 188.3 inches along with a decent width of 81.9 inches (excluding outside mirrors) and a decent height of just about 54.4 inches.There is no doubt that this yet to be launched Ford Mustang has one of the classy interior design with flawless design down to the closest detail. Its cabin is made using a lot of leather upholstery that is highlighted by metallic accents. The design of the interiors are precisely sculptured for those who prefers luxuriant finish inside the cabin. At the same time, there is an ample space available inside this vehicle, especially in the cockpit section. However, the rear compartment has slightly lesser leg and head space, but is comfortable enough for two occupants. All the seats inside are covered with premium leather upholstery, which the customers can choose it with contrast stitching. Both the front seats are separated by a massive floor console, which is housed with cup holders along with a gearshift box. The center fascia is equipped with an advanced infotainment system along with an AC unit and various illuminated control switches.

Its dashboard is something that represents the unique identity of Mustang, as it has a layered design with masculine build. The instrument cluster is quite large has a rectangular design featuring two round shaped meters and a full color display. It notifies the driver with all the important information related to this vehicle.\n\nInterior Comfort:\n\nComing to the interior comforts, there is no information from the company or from the experts regarding what kind of features this vehicle will have on-board. It is most likely that the manufacturer will launch it in two trim levels or else in only one trim, which should not be a surprise to the auto enthusiasts. However, considering its stature and price range, we can expect for several advanced features like those in its international version. Individuals can expect for some of the standard features like an automatic air conditioning system, a power assisted steering with tilt along with telescopic adjustment, electrically operated outside mirrors, automatic headlamps and parking assistance program. At the same time, we can also expect for electrically adjustable front seats including lumbar support and memory function that further adds to the traveling comfort. On the other hand, one can also expect for features like a automatic headlamps, rain sensing wipers, a leather wrapped multi-functional steering wheel, central locking system, keyless entry and several other such aspects.\n\nInterior Measurements:\n\nThere is no doubt that the internal cabin of this upcoming Ford Mustang will be spacious enough to accommodate at least five occupants. Its international version also has a total of 13.5 cubic feet of trunk space along with a massive fuel tank that can store up to 13 gallons. In India, its trunk volume is expected to be the same like above, but we can expect that the fuel tank capacity can be much lower.The variant, which is powered by a 2.3-litre EcoBoost engine is expected to come with both six speed manual and automatic transmission gearbox, which allow the vehicle to reach a top speed of 240 Kmph. In the mean time, one can expect it to break the 100 Kmph speed mark from a standstill in approximately 5 seconds.

sS'Ford Endeavour'
p73
S'IntroductionThe blue oval has had it\xe2\x80\x99s share of hits and misses in the country. While vehicles like the Ikon and the Fiesta were runaway hits, certain models like the Mondeo or the updated Fiesta simply failed to make an impression on Indian consumers.  2015 was an extremely good year for Ford India. The Figo twins and the updated EcoSport are currently leading Ford\xe2\x80\x99s arsenal for the Indian market.However, their claim to fame in India, their piece de resistance, something that helped Ford be an established name in the market was lurking in the shadows and eventually forgotten. However, Ford has now launched an all-new generation of the much loved Endeavour. Can it add to Ford\xe2\x80\x99s revival or be the heaviest anchor in their portfolio? Let\xe2\x80\x99s find out!Pros1. Space. Proper big car that can accommodate 7 adults.2. Build quality. Feels solid and upmarket inside out. A trait that the current Fortuner skimps on.3. Expansive feature list: Panoramic Sunroof, Terrain Management System, Leather Upholstery, electric tail-gate release etc.Cons1. 6-Speed Autobox is lazy to respond to inputs.2. No manual transmission available with the 3.2 litre engine3. Top-spec 2.2 litre version misses out on many features like the sunroof, electrically folding seats etc.Stand Out Features1. Terrain management system. Can choose between Snow, Mud & Grass, Sand and Rock modes for traction across various terrain.2. Programmable second key is a segment first. Can limit audio volume and set a top speed limit.OverviewIn an era where most SUV manufacturers are making their humble giants shed weight, the Endeavour remains as butch and muscular as ever. In an all new avatar, the Endeavour gets some seriously lip-smacking goodies in its feature list. It also gets 2 engine options, along with Ford\xe2\x80\x99s Terrain Management System.Background and EvolutionThe Endeavour was initially launched in December 2003. It received subsequent facelifts in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Updates were mostly cosmetic, save for the 3.0 litre engine that was made available 2008 onwards. However, now; 7 years later - the Endeavour hits Indian shores in a brand new avatar. Read a detailed post on the Endeavour\xe2\x80\x99s evolution here.ExteriorThe Endeavour embodies the philosophy of a quintessential American SUV. What that means is, that all dials are dialled up to 11 when it comes to size. The presence of the Endeavour has definitely improved over its previous iteration.The front is marked by a large hexagonal grille that is drenched in chrome. A large blue oval sits slap bang in the centre. Flanking the grille are two massive headlamps that get projectors and day-time running LEDs. The large bumper houses a hard-plastic skidplate that is finished in matte silver. The skidplate extends upwards and forms the housing for the foglamps. The bonnet gets its own share of muscle with strong character lines running along its length. The muscled hood, flared arches and the massive grille work together in giving the Endeavour a dominating face.The side profile is characterized by the 3XL sized doors and large window area. Two faint character lines run parallel to the window area. The flared wheel arches show their might here, they really bring in a lot of character to the side profile.The Endeavour also gets a side-step (footboard) which aids ingress and egress. Note, that it is almost impossible to get inside the Endeavour without using these.The Ford gets 18 inch wheels shod with 265/60 R18 tyres. While we would have loved to see the Endeavour get the 20\xe2\x80\x9d wheels that the international version gets, we understand that the 18 inchers are a more practical choice for Indian roads.A touch we really liked, was the chrome tab that sits on the front fender. It bears the engine and transmission details. Ford say that a snorkel can be fit there.The rear ditches the famous tail-mounted spare wheel that the Endeavour was known far. The spare wheel now moves under the boot, just like the Fortuner. The rear houses large, wrap-around LED tail-lamps. A massive slab of chrome connects the two lamps together.We really like the Endeavour tag embossed on the chrome. The large rear bumper gets a skidplate too, which mimics the one at the front.The core USP of the original Endeavour was it\xe2\x80\x99s sheer size and bulk. The new one isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot different. It is still massive and imposing in flesh. The new Endeavour is 167 mm shorter, 74 mm wider and 11 mm taller than the outgoing version. Wheelbase is down by 10mm as well. Compared to it\xe2\x80\x99s rivals, the Endeavour has the upper hand when it comes to Length and Height but only slightly.The Endeavour looks like an intimidating, imposing, go-anywhere SUV. The brawny size and well-sculpted lines give it an authoritative stance. We will go out on a limb and say that the Endeavour is the best looking SUV in its segment.InteriorThe massive doors of the Endeavour open equally wide to give you access. One needs to \xe2\x80\x98climb\xe2\x80\x99 inside the Endeavour using the side-step provided. While ingress and egress is convenient, the height may be a problem for the elderly.Once inside, you are greeted by a good-looking and well-finished interior. The quality of parts, fit & finish is definitely a couple of notches higher than the Fortuner or even the Chevrolet Trailblazer for that matter. The slab-sided dashboard is split into three sections. The top portion is draped in Chocolate brown leather, the middle section gets a anthracite/ dark grey colored panel that runs from door to door and beige envelopes the rest. Key take away points here is that everything is well laid-out and falls to hand easily. Ergonomically, the Endeavour scores full marks in our books.The Endeavour is a proper seven seater. To make things plush, all seven seats are upholstered in beige leather. This is one of our gripes with the Endeavour. While beige looks extremely neat, it is an absolute pain to keep clean. The shade is a particularly light shade of beige and gets soiled very very easily. Ford could\xe2\x80\x99ve given an optional all-black interior with the Endeavour.The driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat can be adjusted electrically and have healthy range in terms of fore-aft movement. However, the co-passenger gets a standard manual adjust. The view from the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat is commanding to see the least. You can view the edge of the bonnet and get a nice view of the road ahead. The seats are well-cushioned and supportive. Even for a large guy, the shoulder and lateral back support will be more than adequate. The headrests however are on the harder side. Other than that, the front row is a good place to be in.The second row is no different. The wide bench gets adjustable headrests for all three passengers and a central armrest for when the middle passenger isn\xe2\x80\x99t around.This row can be slid front and back to fine tune legroom. More importantly, the seats can be reclined slightly to make the occupants more comfortable. While the bench is mostly flat, it provides reasonable support. The transmission hump is fairly large too, but the middle occupant has enough space to keep his legs around it . Sitting three abreast isn\xe2\x80\x99t too much of an issue, thanks to the sheer width of the car.One can access the third row by sliding the second row all the way ahead. It is key to note, that the second row of seats do not fold up, hence entry and exit from the third-row isn\xe2\x80\x99t the most dignified of tasks. With the second row slid fully back, the legroom can be termed as average. However, this row can house adults for only short journeys. Due to the lack of under thigh support, the knees point towards the roof. Not the best position to be sitting in for a long time.All three rows, get their own set of AC vents. The Endeavour is equipped with a dual-zone climate control. The dual-zone climate control lets the car maintain different temperatures in each half of the car. The ac vents are roof mounted for passengers in the second and third row. Second row occupants can control fan-speed and temperature for their row too. The air-conditioner works flawlessly, we have no complaints on that front.The steering is a large chunky unit that is wrapped in leather and gets adjustment for rake. We would have loved reach adjustment as well, but considering that the seat can be adjusted in myriad ways - finding a good driving position is hardly a task.However, it houses a total of 22 buttons! While the array of buttons is slightly disorienting at the outset, it becomes intuitive to use as you spend more time with it.10 out of the 22 buttons are used to control the LCD screen on the instrument cluster.The cluster comprises of a large central speedometer flanked by two smaller screens on either side. While the left screen displays audio information, the one on the right displays vehicle parameters such as RPM, Distance to Empty, Trip Meter etc. Readability is fantastic and we particularly like the horizontal gear indicator on the automatic.The centre console is home to the infotainment system and the controls for the dual zone climate control. The 8 inch touchscreen unit is broken into four quadrants and is color coded. The four quadrants are for Phone (yellow), Music (red), Climate Control (blue) and Information (green). Respective features can be controlled directly from the touchscreen and one need not necessarily use the physical buttons or knobs. For example, the AC can be controlled directly from the touchscreen unit.Response from the touchscreen was average, but it did not lag too much. The unit is connected to 10 speakers splattered around the car. Sound quality is rather nice, most won\xe2\x80\x99t feel the need for an audio upgrade.The buttons below the centre console are for the music system and the climate control system. The switches are XL sized and are good to operate. Quality again, is straight from the top-shelf - nothing to complain about.It also gets two 12V chargers at the front, just above a recess that can be used to store your cellphone. The AUX and USB inputs are placed here as well.The centre console flows into the gear-lever area. 4x4 variants get a rotary dial for the Terrain management system here. Switches for the traction control, Park assist can be found here too.There are a lot of cubby holes around the cabin including large bottle holders in the doorpads, a sunglass holder and recesses around the handbrake lever. Not to mention, the glovebox is XL sized and the armrest gets some storage space as well.Our favorite feature on the interior however, is the active-noise cancellation. It employs the same technology as noise-cancelling headphones. The cabin employs tiny mics above the first and second row that pick-up and negate any unwanted sound within the range of 30Hz to 180Hz. .  It really makes the cabin a super-silent place to be in. The panoramic sunroof comes in a close second, its a shame that it is available only on the top-spec 3.2.Boot space is colossal 450 litres; which can be increased to 750 litres with the third rows folded down. Fold the second row of seats away and you have a massive 2010 litres of boot space. (Note: the third row of seats can be electrically folded in the top-spec 3.2 version; others get a manual handle to fold the seats)Engine and PerformanceThe Endeavour is available with two engine options. A smaller 2.2 litre, 4 cylinder engine and a bigger 3.2 litre in-line 5 motor. While the 2.2 is available with a manual as well as an automatic transmission, the 3.2 can be had with the 6-Speed slushbox only. Similarly, the smaller engine gets a 4x2 variant along with a 4x4 - the larger comes only with the latter.Endeavour 2.2Let us get one thing straight first, the 2.2 litre motor in no way feels underpowered for the Endeavour. Yes, more power is always welcome but the 160PS/385Nm combo does just enough to keep the big Ford on it\xe2\x80\x99s toes. The engine does have a bit of turbo-lag upto 2000rpm post which the 385Nm is delivered in a single gush. Low-end grunt is really nice; the peak torque is achieved at just 1600 rpm. You can get the Endeavour rolling of the line in second gear if you wanted to.If you opt for the 2.2 with the 6-speed autobox, a word of advice - do not be in a hurry. The gearbox takes its own sweet time to figure out the gear it is supposed to be in. Especially when you are heavy on the throttle. Be sure to shift to Sports mode or take control of the gears yourself if you need nothing but performance. However, on a relaxed cruise - the gearbox does just fine.Endeavour 3.2Budget no bar, this is the engine to pick. The 3.2 litre motor compliments the Endeavours bulk and size beautifully. While this motor isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a tarmac scorcher either, the 3.2 litre motor has just enough power in its coffers to waft the 2 ton behemoth towards the horizon rather swiftly. Compared to the 2.2, the 3.2 most noticeably has better in-gear acceleration. This ofcourse, boils down to the extra 85Nm of torque that the motor has.Turbo-lag is slightly more evident in the 3.2 compared to the smaller engine, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t too much of a bother. We really wish that Ford made the 3.2 available with a manual transmission - the 6-Speed AT seems to sap the engine\xe2\x80\x99s prowess.The NVH (noise, vibration & harshness levels) on the both the engines are well under control.  Other than the initial vibrations and shake, the sound is well-damped. It is only under harsh acceleration that these noises seep inside the cabin again.Ride and HandlingThe steering is amongst the lighter units out there. At city speeds, it is just as light as you would want it to be. It does weigh up nicely when the speeds climb. The steering feels nice and accurate at high speeds, there is no vagueness or dead-zone as such. In no way, does the Endeavour feel nervous or twitchy at high speeds. In fact, it is among the few cars that can cruise in excess of 120km/h all day long. However, we would advise you to be prudent when the going gets twisty.The Endeavour handles like a 2 ton barge should. Owing to the bulk, there is considerable amount of body roll when you chuck the big boy into a corner. Do remember that the Endeavour is based on the good ol\xe2\x80\x99 body-on-frame construction and is nowhere as poised through the corners as a monocoque (read: Santa Fe). While traction control will ensure that you don\xe2\x80\x99t spin out, some restraint on the right leg won\xe2\x80\x99t harm.Nothing seems to upset the Endeavour; the 225mm of ground clearance lets it make mincemeat out of potholes and other undulations. All such abnormalities in the road surface are shrugged off with a muted thunk. The ride quality gets a big, big thumbs up from us.SafetyThe Endeavour is loaded with safety tech. Dual airbags, ABS with EBD, Traction Control System (TCS), Electronic Stability Program (ESP), Hill Launch Assist comes standard across trims. The Titanium variants get Side and Curtain airbags, whereas the Titanium+ variant gets an airbag for the Driver\xe2\x80\x99s knee as well!VariantsThe Endeavour is available in two engine options and two trim levels i.e., Trend & Titanium.The first engine option, a 2.2 liter is available in a manual 4x2 or 4x4. These are available only in the Trend trim. The second option is a automatic 4x2 which is available in both trim levels.There is no option for an automatic transmission with 4x4.Coming to the brawny 3.2l engine, it is offered only with an Automatic 4x4 transmission and available in both trims. However, the 3.2\xe2\x80\x99s Titanium trim gets a longer list of equipment than the 2.2 titanium.The Endeavour is one of the best equipped cars of its segments. Apart from the regular bells and whistles, the base Trend variant gets flat folding seats, an 8\xe2\x80\x9d touchscreen infotainment system and cruise control.In the Titanium trim, you get a neat set of LED DRLs, front parking sensors along with curtain airbags.To differentiate the 3.2 from the 2.2 in the titanium trim, the 3.2 gets some features like the panoramic sunroof, power folding 3rd row seats and a range rover like terrain management system.While the 3.2 in the top spec (Titanium) seems the most attractive option as it would cater to the demands of buyers in the segment.The Endeavour is one up in terms of pricing as well as on board features when compared to the segment munching Fortuner. The Endeavour is available in two engine options and two trim levels i.e., Trend & Titanium. The first engine option, a 2.2l, is available in a manual 4x2 or 4x4. These are available only in the Trend trim. The second option is a automatic 4x2 which is available in both trim levels. There is no option for an automatic transmission with 4x4 on the 2.2l lineup.Coming to the brawny 3.2l engine, it is offered as an automatic and with 4x4 on both trims. However, you get additional equipment on the 3.2 when compared to the 2.2 in the Titanium trim.Apart from the regular bells and whistles, the base Trend variant gets flat folding seats, an 8\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xc3\x82\xc2\x9d touchscreen infotainment system and cruise control. In the Titanium trim, you get a neat set of LED day time running lights, front parking sensors along with curtain airbags.To differentiate the 3.2 from the 2.2 in the titanium trim, the 3.2 gets some features like the panoramic sunroof, power folding 3rd row seats, driver side knee airbag and a range rover like terrain management system. The 3.2 in the top spec (Titanium) seems the most attractive option as it would cater to the demands of buyers in the segment. The 2.2 too continues to be a good option as in no way does it seem underpowered.VerdictThe Endeavour, in our books is currently the best big SUV you can place your money on. It seems to have all the right boxes ticked. It has the power, it has the technology and most importantly, the presence and aura an SUV in this price slab should have. If you are in the market for a double XL sized SUV, the Endeavour is a brilliant package. It remains to be seen how it fares against the updated Fortuner, whenever Toyota launch it, that is.'

S"Introduction:The Indian auto market has witnessed rapid expansion over the past few years. Brands like Skoda have capitalised on rising demand from the masses and reaped rich rewards. And standing out in the brand's portfolio is its distinctive saloon, the Skoda Superb. This is one of those vehicles that you're likely to glimpse every now and then, a model that seems to combine old school designing with a more modern edge. Now, its new version has been set loose on Indian soil and this has got the media abuzz. The new generation Superb brings fresh design to the model along with great interiors and features. Whether or not it keeps afloat with the current trend is what we're here to decide.The 3rd-Gen Superb brings a more progressive face of the vehicle out, with a sharper look that we thought went perfectly with the image. It is upgraded with new 3D headlamps, a wider air dam at the bottom and horizontal LED fog lamps that compliment the frontage. Coming to the interior, we thought there was a striking similarity with the cabin of the Volkswagen Passat, a close competitor of this model. Passengers are sure to get a feel of added space in this vehicle, a result of its longer wheelbase. The new version boasts some pretty engaging features, including a Touchscreen Infotainment system among many others. In place of the old \xe2\x80\x98Elegance\xe2\x80\x99 variant, this model comes with two brand new trim levels, Style and L&K. Coming to a more raw facet, the vehicle hosts the same 1.8-litre petrol engine and 2.0-litre diesel engine, both of which have been up-tuned for more power output.Pros:1. Its comfort features are sure to dazzle anyone.2.  The outer profile is a definite head-turner.Cons:1. Fuel economy of the petrol engine is sub-par.2. The interiors lack substantial changes.Stand-out Features:1. The new version comes with a 6.5 inch colour touchscreen Infotainment system, and this is a definite bonus.2. The 2.0-litre diesel engine makes for strong performance.Overall:The 3rd-Gen Superb brings a more progressive face of the vehicle out, with a sharper look that we thought went perfectly with the image. It is upgraded with new 3D headlamps, a wider air dam at the bottom and horizontal LED fog lamps that compliment the frontage. Coming to the interior, we thought there was a striking similarity with the cabin of the Volkswagen Passat, a close competitor of this model. Passengers are sure to get a feel of added space in this vehicle, a product of its longer wheelbase. The new version boasts some pretty engaging features, including a Touchscreen Infotainment system among many others. In place of the old \xe2\x80\x98Elegance\xe2\x80\x99 variant, this model comes with two brand new trim levels, Style and L&K. Coming to a more raw facet, the vehicle hosts the same 1.8-litre petrol engine and 2.0-litre diesel engine, both of which have been up-tuned for more power output.Exterior:The new Superb comes with some noticeable exterior changes, and it's clear that the company wishes to build upon the genuine look of this machine. Most people would be able to trace a sporty character in its low and dynamic shape. Rich design elements further boost the look, with chrome labels and sharp body lines complementing the overall form.At the front, its signature butterfly grille remains the same, with a chrome surround further enhancing the image. On either side, the sharp 3D headlamps blend into the front perfectly, and we thought they sent out a more aggressive statement.This version\xe2\x80\x99s bumper has a renewed, sporty look and the wider air dam at the bottom felt good for the overall picture. The new Superb comes with horizontal, LED Fog lamps by the skirts.If you look closely, you're sure to spot a chrome strip at the lower end of the air dam, and we thought this sets up a more vibrant aura for the vehicle. Meanwhile, the wide bonnet adds a muscular theme to the look, with serene lines that bring a more energetic persona to the front.The gentle metallic skin blankets over the wheel arches, adding a touch of prominence to the region. Polished curves and clean lines bring a more powerful, sweeping look to the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s side profile.The company basks in the Indian people's love for chrome, with chrome side door strips and chrome side window frames that would delight most people. For this new edition, the 17-inch alloy wheels invite a more graceful look and you're sure to love the well sculpted rims.A more animated picture is created by the body coloured door handles and mirrors. When you take a look at the side of the vehicle, you're sure to feel the dynamism of its well balanced design. More bulk is added to the rear, with the roofline tapering down gently towards the boot. We thought that the sporty charisma of the machine was marvellous.The tail-lamps broaden outside of the boot, giving the rear region a more invigorated look. The boot lid has a refined chrome strip and we thought it was the perfect finish for the vehicle's look.Interiors:The cabin made a mark in our minds with its well spread, rich taste, along with the presence of numerous comfort aids. Much of the inside remains the same, but the new version exudes a more spacious feeling as a result of a longer wheelbase. We thought that the colour scheme was just right, wrapping the space in a more holistic aura that is sure to appease anyone.The upper side of the dashboard is furnished with a wood design d\xc3\xa9cor that brings a more enriched quality to the space. At the centre, the 6.5-inch LCD TFT display invites a more sophisticated air into the cabin, with the buttons propped on either side of the screen for ease of usage. The Infotainment system is a new feature of this edition, and it is sure to delight pretty much anyone who steps into this place.Incorporated below this is a dual zone AC system, which comes along with 2 individual knobs for adjusting the temperature control. The steering wheel is wrapped in leather, with a sporty design that we did admire. Steering controls have been integrated by the side of the wheel, with paddle shift behind the wheel.Inlays of wood embrace the door-sides as well, boosting the plush layout of the vehicle. The interior door handles have been lavished in chrome, while chrome door sills at the front and rear come along with the 'Superb' inscription for a more distinctive effect.The well structured seats relieve you of most discomforts you'd face in other vehicles, and the presence of headrests is an added bonus.Legroom was decent at the front as well as the rear, but if you're accustomed to larger and more lavishly laid vehicles, then you might have problems stretching out in here. Nevertheless, large and bulky members of our team had little issues during the ride.All of the seats are dressed in lavish Nappa leather and we thought that this particular factor stood out among any other in the ride.Performance:Diesel:For the diesel version, the company has used the same 2.0-litre TDI mill, but attuned to pump out more power and torque. This 1968cc oil burner has a turbocharger as well as a liquid cooling system. A high-pressure direct injection system ensures smooth transfer of fuel. It is now capable of pumping out 174.5bhp of power at between 3600-4000rpm and a torque of 350Nm between 1500rpm to 3500rpm. It comes with the same cylinder configuration like earlier with 4 cylinders and 16 valves incorporated together through the double overhead camshaft arrangement. Shifting is made much easier with a 6-speed automatic gearbox, and we're sure most drivers would enjoy the overall experience. As a result improvements, the train now puts out a mileage of 18.19kmpl, infusing a degree of fuel economy into the drive as well.Petrol:The petrol variants too get an improved 1.8-litre TSI engine that displaces 1798cc. It is now capable of producing a power of 177.46bhp between 5100-6200rpm along with a torque of 250Nm at 1250rpm to 5000rpm for the automatic version and 320Nm at 1450rpm to 3900rpm for the manual version. A turbocharger, a liquid cooling system and a direct fuel injection system together help to bolster the working of the engine. Like its diesel counterpart, it also gets a 4-cylinder configuration with same double overhead camshaft arrangement. The petrol engine can be opted to come with either a 6-speed manual gearbox or a 7-speed DSG automatic transmission. The petrol engine falls behind with regard to fuel economy, with a rather weak mileage value of 14.67kmpl for automatic and 14.12kmpl for the manual, which many people might find below par.Ride and Handling:The new edition retains the same braking and suspension systems. Altogether, you might find the overall ride quality to be more pleasant than today's mainstream releases. Regular road hassles, including pot-holes, are easily digested by the car's inner dynamics. Nevertheless, you're not going to be spared jitters in some of the country's more ruthless road formats, but otherwise ride condition was good. The front axle of the chassis is rigged with a McPherson strut. The presence of a torsion stabiliser and lower triangular links helps keep the ride calm. The rear axle has been compounded with a multi-element axle that also comes with a torsion stabiliser. Along with this, a longitudinal and three transverse links further elevate the ride comfort. As for the braking capacity, we had no problems pushing the vehicle through tight turns and tense corners, and stopping distance was also easily achieved. The hydraulic dual-diagonal circuit braking system comes along with vacuum assist and a dual rate system. Disc brakes have been clamped onto all wheels, with the front brakes also getting inner cooling and a single piston floating caliper.Safety:The new edition comes with parking sensors that helps reversing easier and flawless. Apart from this, we found the safety area to be nearly impeccable, with a broad range of security features that touch nearly every aspect of the ride. Anti-lock braking system, Electronic brake force distribution system, Mechanical brake assist, Hydraulic brake assist, Anti slip regulation and many other drive programs help to seal control and stability when driving. A robust airbag system shields the occupants, including dual front airbags, curtain airbags and side airbags. We thought that the restraint system was also up to the mark, with the presence of pretensioners and active front head restraints. Apart from all this, the dynamic lighting system helps to prevent mishaps. It includes an adaptive front-light system, Bi-Xenon headlamps that come along with headlamp levelling function, fog lamps that come along with a cornering function and warning indicators on all doors.Variants:There are two trim levels in the model series, Style and L&K. There are features shared by both trim levels and features unique to each of them as well. Style comes with some exclusive features, such as a chrome door sill with \xe2\x80\x98Superb Inscription\xe2\x80\x99, Stone Beige leather upholstery and Helios alloy wheels that grant a more distinctive outer look. On the inside, this variant gets an eight speaker audio system and a MaxiDot multi-function that displays travelling time, fuel consumption, distance travelled, average speed, etc. Meanwhile, the higher end L&K trim comes with many exclusive features, such as a fatigue detection driver assist, 12-way adjustable front passenger seat, a 12-speaker Canton sound system, a tyre pressure monitoring system, a 3-zone climatronic temperature control, air conditioned front seats, an electronically controlled 5th door. Verdict:With the new edition of Skoda Superb, the industry gets a new benchmark to strive towards. This is a car with great promise and we thought that the company has done a great job giving it a new and refreshed aura altogether. The Superb\xe2\x80\x99s spacious set-up, excess of comfort features, its strong safety sector and its glamorous exterior cover together are sure to go well with customers. However, it does have some let-downs as well: Its hefty price tag and its engine performance would certainly ward off those looking for some real fervour in the ride. At the end of the day, the Superb is for you if you're looking for a moderately comfortable driving experience. Meanwhile, for the thriftier lot and for those looking for an over-the-top ride experience, we'd recommend something else."

S"Nissan Micra Active is a hatchback series that is available in petrol version and in three variants. The top end trim which is suffixed with the term 'Safety' is equipped with all the protective functions that a small car is expected to possess. Driver as well as the co-passenger has an airbag, there is anti lock braking system along with an electronic brake-force distribution complimented by a brake-assist, an immobilizer for anti-theft and anti-intrusion brake pedals for greater brake efficiency. Along with keyless entry there is central door locking facility as well. There are many notifications that comprise of warnings and reminders for added safety. With regards to its handling efficiency, this section is equipped with an electronic power assisted rack and pinion based steering system and also has about 4.65 meters of minimum turning radius. Plenty of automated functions such as power windows to all the doors, head restraints are adjustable, outside rear view mirrors can be electronically adjusted and tilt steering facilities are provided by the manufacturer in this hatch. External image is designed to look sporty and chic at the same time. This was achieved by the designers by painting the bumpers on the front and rear in body colour. Even the outside rear view mirrors and the outside door handles too are layered in the body tone for making the overall picture uniform. This series is available in six vibrant shades to choose from. Owing to a massive 2450mm of wheelbase, this cabin has a capacity to facilitate about five occupants with great ease. Company has offered cup and bottle holders, glove box and rear parcel shelf, map pockets and front console in order to store some handy stuff inside the cabin. Apart from this, it also possesses a trunk room capacity of 251 litres which is very useful in case of planning for a long trip in the small car. Fuel economy of about 19.49 Kmpl on highways and 16 to 17 Kmpl in cities will also compliment in undertaking long journeys. This is in compliance with BS IV emission standard norms. A standard variant of about two years or 50,000 kilometres is available. The company also offers 24/7 roadside assistance in numerous cities all over the nation..The outsides are done up very modestly with several features to talk about in it. All the variants are offered with front and rear body colored bumpers. Whereas, the front bumper is very sporty as well as curvy and adds to the already stylish hatch. There is a large air dam in the center, which helps air intake that further aids in engine cooling. Its front windscreen is quite broad and is fitted with a couple of intermittent wipers and a washer. Its headlight cluster is equipped with halogen lamps along with side turn indicators as well. In the top spec trims, its external rear view mirrors as well as outside door handles are painted in body color, while the other trims have them in black color. Additionally, its neatly carved out wheel arches are covered with full wheel covers, which are offered to the top two variants. The outside rear view mirrors are fitted on both the sides in all the trims except for the base and mid level trim. Coming to its rear end, there is a license plate console, a company's prominent badge affixed in the center, a large windscreen and the regular variant badging as well.Exterior Measurements:Its base variant has an overall length of 3780mm and the rest have a total length of 3801mm. This hatchback also have a width of 1665mm (this includes the external mirrors as well) and a decent height of 1530mm. Having a massive wheelbase of 2450mm of wheelbase will allow for a very spacious cabin. A ground clearance of 154mm is not that impressive.Ed's take : The interiors of the Micra have been given a treatment, and now it has several new features too. The space is sufficient with decent seating. The new piano black centre console adds more styling to the existing instrument panel design.The insides are integrated with quite a few standard aspects, which are available in almost all vehicles of this segment. These are one of the important parts related to the driver as well as the occupant's comfort. In order to regulate the cabin temperature, an air conditioning unit is decked into all the variants, which comes with well placed vent for better air regulation and it also has a heater, if needed and is manually operated. Its control knobs are on the central console for easier access to the driver and the co-passenger. There are a set of sun visors fitted for the driver as well as to the co-driver, while the passenger visor is fitted with a vanity mirror for added convenience. A 12V power outlet is offered in all the variants except for the base version. This outlet can be utilized for the purpose of charging any electronic devices while on the move. There are three assist grips for all the passengers apart from the driver, which are fixed in all the trims apart from the base trim. There are cup and bottle holders in the central console along with a spacious glove box for keeping quite a few things handy, whenever required during the journey. All its seats are covered with fine fabric upholstery, which further adds sheen to the already good looking insides. Both the front seats are adjustable as per the need of the driver and the front co-passenger, which adds to the utility value of this model series. The dashboard and other plastic material used inside are of good quality and the designers have done a good job pertaining to the finishing of the overall interiors.Interior Comfort:Ample of comfort features are equipped in this small car that makes for a great drive experience all through. Power steering will reduce the effort of the driver to a great extent. This additionally has a tilt adjustable facility allowing the driver to change the arm position. All the doors are integrated with power windows to provide further convenience. There is an air conditioner equipped which will be regulated manually. And then the AC vents are placed well around the cabin in order to circulate the air to every corner equally. For the entertainment sake, there is a music system that has a radio tuner with AM/FM and also can support USB and Aux-in ports as well. This audio unit is complimented by speakers that are integrated in the front as well as at the rear too. Another advantageous automated function is that the outside rear view mirrors can be adjusted internally. There are sun visors to the driver as well as to the co-passenger, while the co-driver side visor is fitted with a vanity mirror.

sS'Mahindra Ssangyong Rexton'
p93
S"The Mahindra Ssanyong Rexton is a muscular looking SUV series, that is available only in a diesel guise and with 3 variants. One of them is an automatic trim. Though it is a utility vehicle, the manufacturers have taken care in making it appealing with its external design, which can be noticed in the first glance itself. Its skin carries a chrome based radiator grille, eagle eye shaped headlamps, body toned bumpers with a couple of integrated fog lamps, a set of 16-inch, 10-spoke alloys along with sporty rear spoiler and a specially designed company emblem. The most significant aspect of any utility vehicle is its performance, then the safety quotient and its carrying capacity. First in line, the performance is not compromised as it has an all wheel drive mechanism and an intelligent 4x4 torque-on-demand system with a low ratio and an ability to accelerate up to speeds of about 180 to 194 Kmph. Its braking mechanism is supported by ABS and EBD along with electronic stability program and hill descent control plus disc brakes to all wheels among others. Pertaining to the safety quotient of this vehicle and the occupants in it, the overall body is made up of reinforced steel panels and crumple zones to distribute the collision impact force without crushing the cabin. Additionally, an active slip and active roll-over protection is useful while off-roading particularly. Seatbelts, dual front airbags safeguard occupants from fatal injuries, while an engine immobilizer will keep the vehicle safe from thefts. Next in line is the storage efficiency, which is is justified by a massive 475 litres boot space and an ability to withhold 78 litres in its fuel tank, both beneficial in planning for long journeys. All the rest of its factors will only accord to the comfort present in this series. There are many exclusive features incorporated and one among them is a 3 preset memory storage for the driver seat customized adjustments along with external mirror adjustments according to that particular driver. An infotainment system that can support quite a lot of multimedia functions along with touch capacity screen and video function as well is present. Rain sensing wipers can be of great help during monsoon. Automatic headlamps that work through sensors will be useful during drives on runways especially where switching-on/off in the middle of the drive is not very pleasant. The automatic version not only alleviates the driver's engagement in shifting gears, but also wouldn't allow to even stretch arms any further than the steering wheel. This is enabled in this model by equipping thumbs up/down switches on the gear shift knob and steering wheel to change gears with a lot of ease. Apart from these, there is a speed sensitive power steering with tilt adjustment. The electric sunroof has sun blinds to it, a cigarette lighter is there and there are about 3 sockets with 12V power for charging small electronic devices. Other automated functions are auto dimming inter rear view mirror and sunglass holder, electrically foldable, adjustable plus heated external mirrors. All these contribute not just in making the drive strain-free, but also a pleasure. Company offers an impressive three years or 1,00,000 kilometres of warranty is well known for after-sale service.This SUV looks very robust yet elegant for a utility vehicle. The very structure itself gives an impression of sophistication. Nothing extraordinary is attached to its shell, but whatever is present, is offered in a neat and decent design. Its richness is achieved by its simplicity in its design. On the front, one can see a chrome radiator grille with Rexton emblem sitting over it in style. There are headlamp cluster, which has similarity to an eagle eye on either sides and a simple airdam right below the body toned bumper. The turn indicators integrated outside rear view mirrors and blacked out window sills and pillars give a decent and contrasting appearance to its sides. Spoiler at the rear and rails on the roof are an added decoration. Rear end is further styled by a pair of LED tail lamps with L-shaped parking lights. Overall image is dominated by a classy set of 10-spoke alloy rims fitted to the wheel arches, which are further equipped with tubeless radials.\n\nExterior Measurements:\n\nIts dimensions are pretty generous and justifying its massive appearance. An overall length is 4755mm along with a total width is about 1900mm. It stands at a height of 1785mm (without roof rails). A ground clearance of 208mm is good enough for a utility vehicle on Indian roads.Ed's Take: The interiors of the Rexton has spacious and do feel premium. The plastic quality is good and the overall fit and finish is decent. The third row of seats are disappointing as there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any kneeroom.\n The dual tone black and beige interiors look good as a combination of two colors make an interesting design. One can see metal grain accents all over the cabin. Top end variant is bestowed with leather wrapped steering wheel, gear shift knob and leather seats as well. There are three 12V power sockets \xe2\x80\x93 1 on the dashboard, the other below front passenger seat and another one in the trunk. Reading lamps are fitted to the roof for all three rows. Premium floor mats will keep the cabin clean. An illumination is there for the spacious glove box that can be used to store quite a few things.\n\nInterior Comfort:\n\nA lot of luxury features are incorporated in this vehicle, which justifies its price range. The driver's seat has 8-way electrically adjustable facility along with lumbar support. The outside rear view mirrors can be electrically adjusted, folded and heated as well. A cigarette lighter and an ashtray are also available. Steering wheel can be adjusted and audio controls are mounted onto it that adds to the convenience of its driver. Driver and co-passenger have sun-visors with mirrors and lights. All the rows have air-conditioning vents and the third row has blower controls as well. Sunglass holder, coat hooks and map pockets contribute to the inner storage capacity. Power windows with auto up/down switch for driver side window and keyless entry are other functions that offer added comfortableness.\n\nInterior Measurements:\n\nA wheelbase of about 2,835mm enables to have a spacious cabin in which there is plenty of leg room and shoulder space along with a generous head room which lets even tall occupants seat comfortably. The boot space can contain 475 litres within it and the fuel tank capacity is of 78 litres.Ed's Take: Despite being such large in size, the Rexton has good acceleration.

The efficiency on the auto mode isn\xe2\x80\x99t that bad either.\n All its trims run based on a common rail direct injection fuel supply system. The manual gear box variants have a mileage of 9.4 Kmpl in the city that stretches up to 12.4 Kmpl on highways. While the automated gear box trim is efficient enough to deliver 11.18 Kmpl on runways and limits to 8.18 Kmpl under the standard driving conditions.Ed's Take: The power of the Rexton automatic is good, despite the sluggish nature of the gearbox. The manual has a new variant RX6, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t permanent four-wheel drive.All its variants have a displacement capacity of 2696cc. The trims mated to a manual transmission gear box can generate a maximum power of 162bhp at 4000rpm and a torque of 340Nm at 1800 to 3250rpm.

It is essentially the existing version of Linea, but with few upgrades to its engine and with some minor changes to its styling.This soon to be launched vehicle features exclusive cosmetics such as blackened roof, outside mirrors and alloy wheels. We can also see exclusive badging of the variant on its boot-lid.Moving on with the existing version of Linea, it looks more like a budget car. Although it received facelift in 2014, the Linea failed to garner attention, thanks to its sobered front facia.Its headlight cluster bears a dual barrel design featuring conventional lamps. The manufacturer should have offered projector headlamps instead of dual parabola headlamps. Most other rivals of Linea including the likes of Ciaz and Verna come with projector headlamps.The redesigned radiator grille has dated design with extensive chrome treatment to its surround strip. There are two horizontal strips in it garnished with glossy black. The company's emblem is positioned in the center of grille.Its front bumper is the only thing that could attract you. It looks drastically different from its predecessor and has bigger air vents and a premium design rendering a class look to the car. Unlike other sedans, there is an extensive use of chrome that adds to the sophistication.The side profile of the car has a similar design to that of its predecessor or perhaps, it looks precisely the same as its earlier version. Even the design of alloy wheels remains the same. Its base and mid-range variants get 15-inch steel rims, while the range topper Emotion gets 16-inch alloy wheels.As we all know, Fiat has displayed the performance version of its family sedan, the Linea 125s at the Auto Expo 2016. This car is seen with black alloy wheels and red disc brake calipers exuding the sense of sportiness.The rear profile of the car has a contemporary look like every other C segment sedan. We can see a great amount of chrome on the boot-lid and bumper as well. The taillight cluster too has chrome underlining that makes for a rich appeal.This contemporary sedan measures 4596mm in length, 1730mm in its width and stands at a height of 1487mm. It also has a long wheelbase of 2603mm, but Ciaz has the longest wheelbase in this class with 2650mm.Linea is more like a classy looking sedan without much of modern design traits. However, its build quality, fit and finish is something better than other conventional sedans of today.Interiors:The 2014 version of Linea received a significant makeover to its interior design exceeding all the expectations of average auto lovers. Its cabin is spacious, well designed and equally well arranged over its predecessor. This sedan has class leading cabin space and ergonomic seating arrangement, making for a comfortable travelling experiencing. Also, it is loaded with good package of features ensuring convenient and comfortable drive. Company's recent introduction at the auto show Linea 125s also features the same design like its existing variants. However, it features a few additional equipments including an infotainment system.Step inside the vehicle and you'll notice the dual tone dashboard. The colour scheme looks bright unlike other sedans. The fit and finish inside the car is far better and it will surely surprise you. However, the design still lacks that modern touch.The central console of dashboard gets some glossy black inserts rendering an upmarket look to the cabin. These inserts are seen around the infotainment system and the AC vents.The instrument cluster has a twin-pod design with sporty dials. It features four analogue gauges along with a digital display aiding driver to receive all the vital information related to the car. Also, it features a few warning lights.The 2014 Linea gets a conventional 3-spoke, yet a stylish steering wheel that feels premium. It features multi-functional switches, which feels smooth and easy to operate. The company is offering the range-topper Emotion trim with leather upholstery.The most important thing for any sedan is its seating arrangement and this Linea lives up to our expectations by offering good support and comfort. The seating design is based on sound ergonomics, while its side bolsters aid in offering better support to the body.The rear bench seat also has an ergonomic design. But, we really felt surprised with the rear seating, thanks to the excellent thigh support and greater leg space. Here, you also get a center armrest with cup holders and a storage tray as well.This car is loaded with all important equipments and features. Its central console houses an integrated music system featuring a CD player and few other connectivity ports, while the high end version also gets a CD player and an automatic climate control unit. It is unfortunate that the car didn't get a touch screen infotainment system. However, this feature is on offer for the recently launched Elegante edition. This limited edition trim features a 6.5-inch multifunctional touch screen infotainment system along with a CD/MP3 player and radio with AM/FM tuner. Besides USB and AUX-In connectivity ports, it also supports Blue&Me hands free system.This car has a boot space capacity of about 500-litres, and we can expand it further by folding the rear bench seat.This 2014 Linea is unquestionably the spacious sedan in its class and far more comfortable than its nearest rivals. But the cabin design lacks that sheer modern look like those in the Ciaz and Honda CityPerformance:The existing version of Linea comes with two engine options including the 1.4-litre T-Jet petrol motor and a 1.3-litre Multijet diesel engine.Petrol engine:The 1.4-litre T-Jet petrol motor is known for its sheer performance. With a power output of 112.4bhp, it outperforms every single car in its class. Ignite the engine and you\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2ll feel its power right away. You'll find it hard to stop yourself from revving it up at idle. Such is the efficiency of T-Jet petrol motor. Pick-up and acceleration of this version is simply outstanding. Its high torque output at low rpms makes city driving even more exciting. But the real fun comes only on highways and it can easily go beyond 160 kmph mark. Even at a speed of 110 kmph, the engine feels relaxed and ready to go even further. The transmission duty of this engine is handled by a 5-speed manual gearbox that offers smooth shifting of gears. The other one is a Fire petrol engine that also comes with same displacement capacity and configuration like its T-Jet counterpart. However, it churns out less power of 88.8bhp at 6000rpm and the torque of 115Nm at 4500rpm, which is drastically lower than T-Jet mill. On the other hand, the recently unveiled Linea 125s trim is said to be more powerful with an output of 123bhp and a torque of 210Nm.Diesel Engine:The diesel version of Linea gets a critically acclaimed and most awarded 1248cc oil-burner. This motor has been the game changer for Fiat, especially in the country like India. It is powerful, efficient and reliable, as compared to any other motor in its class. Driving the Linea with this 1.3-Multijet under the hood feels absolute fun. Its power deliver remains linear and the response of engine is amazing. Its drivability on city roads is so simple, thanks to the low end torque. This motor can pump out a maximum power of 91.7bhp at 4000rpm and a maximum torque of 209Nm at just 2000rpm. However, its mileage is a big letdown, since it returns only about 20.4 kmpl.Ride and Handling:All the variants except T-Jet versions come with disc and drum braking mechanism, while the T-Jet variants are loaded with disc brakes for all four wheels. Adding to this, the anti lock braking system and electronic brake-force distribution makes driving for more predictable. This ABS feature is available as standard for Dynamic, Emotion and all T-Jet variants. The Linea gets a superior suspension system as well. This car's front axle has an independent wheel type of layout and the rear one gets a torsion beam type of mechanism. Both these axles are further loaded with helical coil springs along with double acting telescopic dampers and stabilizer bars that enables it to deal with all the irregularities on the roads. Not but the least, this sedan gets a highly responsive power steering system that makes for a predictable handling.Safety:Safety standards of this sedan are at par with other best-selling sedans. That\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s because of its sturdy build quality and features it has. Even the base versions in the line-up gets automatic door locking facility, fire prevention system and an engine immobilizer with rolling code. Also, they have features like double crank prevention system and central door locking. The mid range and the top-spec variants get all-four disc braking mechanism as standard (T-Jet petrol version only). In addition to these, they also have dual stage driver airbag with early crash sensor and a front passenger airbag as well.Variants:This current version of Linea comes in three trim levels namely Active, Dynamic and Emotion. 'Active' is the entry level variant featuring all standard and essential features ob-board. This base variant comes packed with a manual HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) unit along with foot level AC vents for rear passengers seat as well. This variant also comes with few other features including electrically adjustable outside mirrors, interior roof light with dimming effect, rear defogger with timer, power windows, remote keyless entry and most importantly, an integrated music player with 4 speakers. If you are a budget conscious person, then going for this base variant would save a lot of money.The next-in-line Dynamic variant has few additional features including an automatic climate control unit, driver seat height adjuster, reverse parking sensors, an audio system with Blue&Me feature, 6 speakers, USB/AUX-In connectivity and a multi-functional steering wheel.The high-end 'Emotion' variant on the other hand gets sophisticated features including a cruise control unit, ambient lighting on dashboard, premium leather seating upholstery and 16-inch alloy wheels.Verdict:In our opinion, Fiat Linea is a decent car to go with. Despite of a few shortcomings, it has enough features that offer a great value for money. Besides, its performance is simply the best in its class. Its cabin is spacious and far more comfortable in the C-segment. However, it lacks the styling of a modern car, which is unfortunate. If you are a budget-conscious person and looking for a reliable and a durable car in the segment, then Linea is the one for you."

S'Ferrari 458 Speciale, the most extreme road-legal from Ferrari has been unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show September this year. If we watch it from a naked eye, it appears nothing more than a regular 458 but the content hidden underneath says the whole story making this supercar truly worthy of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeciale\xe2\x80\x9d insignia. The new model from Ferrari is innovation to new active aerodynamic and traction modification technologies to make it the fastest and capable Ferrari roadster to grace a track. It sports very interesting specs under the hood retaining the same but slightly tuned 4.5L V-8 powertrain from the base 458 Italia. It generates massive power of 596hp and 540Nm of torque. However the torque value remains the same as in the base 458, its horsepower has been increased by 34hp. Ferrari has been claiming this as the highest figure ever achieved by a naturally aspirated road car engine which edges it closer to its opponent McLaren 12c (616bhp). The engine is coupled with a seven-speed F1 dual clutch paddle-shift transmission gearbox. This great combination allows this beast to achieve 100kmph in mere 3 seconds of time reaching the top speed of 325kmph which Ferrari claims the highest lateral acceleration in any of its roadsters. This supercar also features a new Side Slip Angle Control System that instantly senses oversteering and automatically manages torque delivery and distribution via Formula 1-Trac traction control and E-Diff electronic differential. The advance combination of tailored Michelin Pilot Sport Cup2 tyres helps in improving balance and traction. The braking system has also been upgraded with the introduction of new calipers inspired from LaFerrari. Not only this, Ferrari 458 Speciale also shows its improved emission ratings with 275g CO2/km against 307g CO2/km in 458 coupe. The first and foremost thing that to be noticed in this cranked-up 458 Speciale is its graceful red paint job and combination of blue and white stripes lying on it giving it a stunning look. Front fascia of the car has been given much treatment with more sculptured bonnet giving more room for ventilation. It now features a reverse-vented hood which permits free air flow and help reduce drag. Rear has striking similarity to the racecar with larger diffuser and dual integrated exhaust pipes replacing the standard 458\xe2\x80\x99s trio tailpipes. Ferrari in its latest offering has installed a heavily tailored front skirt which it has named \xe2\x80\x9cmoveable aerodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d that increases downforce and help in lower dragging. As per other aerodynamic enhancing mods, they can be seen easily seen as on the outer edges of the front clothing, a wide opening and reverse-vented hood. In addition to this, Ferrari also reduced this supercar\xe2\x80\x99s weight to 1290kg from stock weight of 1380kg. The interiors of the car follow the architecture of Italia with a few elegant and purposeful modifications. Sabelt racer seats are affixed featuring standard carbon-fiber shells with presence of Alcantara. The glovebox and carpets have been omitted. The steering wheel inside are perfectly carved holding loads of buttons without any ordinary audio and cruise controlling functions. The lower right of the car, there is housed in a carbon fiber insert, the red Manetinno commutator switch that controls all five performance settings. The lower left holds Scarlet engine start key, when pushed coughs to life like a challenging monster clearing the throat after waking from a deep sleep. As far as instrument cluster is concerned, it has received a yellow-face treatment displaying \xe2\x80\x9c458 Speciale\xe2\x80\x9d on the screen. Ferrari claims that some of the first time introduced innovative features will make way for its future road cars to come with SSC and active aerodynamic dead certs. The core engineering philosophy revolves around pushing the cover with each new model and at the same time maintaining the inherent chassis balance and handling, ensuring that even amateur can get maximum driving pleasure. As far as competition is concerned, the newest addition from Ferrari will lock horns with Lamborghini Gallardo Squadra Corse 2013. As for now, unfortunately the model presented by Ferrari is a concept model to show off future technology to its potential buyers, so we are not expecting this prancing horse hitting our showrooms soon. But it is sure that Ferrari will release Speciale\xe2\x80\x99s price and production number soon and it is expected to bear a price tag of around US$ 400,000 (INR. 25204800.00).'

This is not offered to the base trim. Additionally, electronic power assisted steering system that is very responsive. A minimum turning radius of about 4.8 meters is good for handling the vehicle on narrow roads.Ed's Take: The Etios Cross petrol gets all the safety features airbags and ABS, however, this is an optional package on the diesel version.Plenty of features are equipped in this section to provide strong protection to the vehicle as well as to the passengers. Airbags are present for the driver and co-driver too which are based on supplemental restraint system. An anti-lock braking system with an electronic brake force distribution is equipped in GD variant. A keyless entry and an engine immobilizer will minimize theft related worries by avoiding unauthorized access. Its body structure is well built in order to reduce the impact caused by collision.

Additionally, boot compartment has a full size spare wheel along with a tool kit which will be useful in changing a flat tyre.1. Shoulder and head space is an advantage. 2. Plenty of comfort enhancing features. 3. Very compelling external design. 4. Performance of the diesel motor is impressive. 5. Cabin is uniquely designed.1. Boot space is less. 2. Petrol variants are not fuel efficient. 3. Lack of leather upholstery. 4. Price range a notch too high. 5. Safety quotient needs to be improved."

Now this segment isn\xe2\x80\x99t new, and manufacturers have tried before with the likes of Mahindra and Tata coming up with the Scorpio Getaway and the Xenon respectively. But for some reason, they failed to get the attention they really deserved. Was it because the market wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready for such vehicles? Or, it was because of the vehicles incapability, is something that remains unanswered. Isuzu has already been making sturdy pick-up\xe2\x80\x99s in the Indian market, however, they were more for commercial use rather than fitting in the lifestyle segment. At the 2016 Auto Expo, they showcased the D-Max V-Cross, which really got the crowds going.

However, it gets a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system and tilt adjustable steering wheel with audio controls. The car also comes with automatic AC, 6-way adjustable wrap around driver seat, electrically foldable ORVMs and rear seats with a 60:40 split.The new interior makes the Isuzu D-Max look more upmarket than the company's even more premium MU-7 SUV.

S"Mahindra Supro van is the latest product in the utility vehicle segment, wherein Maruti Omni is still continuing its dominance. By its appearance, this vehicle looks much more like a people mover or like a maxi cab. However, the manufacturer ensured that it isn't just about an affordable mobility solution, but also about style and comfort. Starting off with the exteriors, we can see Mahindra's signature radiator grille up-front with chrome garnishing. Also, it has the company's logo embedded beautifully onto it. On its side profile, we can see body decals that somewhat add style to this van. But one cant deny the fact that the vehicle looks like the one made from scratch. Its interior design looks far better than its outer structure and can provide accommodation for eight adults. Its cabin has a dual color scheme giving a soothing effect to the eyes. This latest model from M&M has been launched in a total of three trims, all of which are powered by a 909cc diesel engine. This oil-burner is currently powering some small commercial vehicles of this company. Being a 2-cylindered mill, it produces a power output of 45bhp, which is good enough to move this 8-seater. By the way, its mid range VX trim is available with 5 and 8 seater option, while the top end ZX trim is purely a five seater. There are not many features associated with this van, since it is in the entry level segment meant to cut down the mobility cost. However, there are few essentials like a heating, ventilation and air conditioning unit that reduces the amount of stress by a greater extent. Also, there are facilities like mobile charger (12V), a digital clock, magazine pockets and a multi utility box. For the convenience of driver, this vehicle also gets an electric power assisted steering that simplifies the handling.\n\nMoving on to the safety section, it has a special front nose design ensuring maximized safety of occupants. This vehicle also gets the Mahindra's tough and rugged body structure with impact protection beams at crucial areas. Its dual LSPV braking mechanism is another factor that helps to improve control over the van, especially in case of sudden braking. Available with a warranty of 60,000 kilometers for 2-years, this vehicle comes as an ideal option for families.This is where company has applied reduced efforts in making this van. As we can see, its exterior structure represents outdated design. But the factors like body decals and chrome accents compensates for lack of proper design. On the front facade, we can see the signature radiator grille with vertical slats. Accompanied with this is a horizontal chrome strip, which is embedded with the company's logo. On its surround, there are headlight cluster housing halogen lamps, courtesy lights and turn blinkers. Its large front bumper is the one that adds bold appeal to this profile. It has a perforated air intake section along with provisions for fog lamp housings. Its front profile is the only thing, which is stylish about this van. The design of its sides is something that we can call it as a fashion disaster. It only has a basic design of an automobile. Its window frames and pillars looks cluttered, which isn't adding any style. The only style factor of this facet is the body decals. Its fenders are accompanied by standard steel rims, but they are accompanied with full wheel covers. The second row gets sliding doors that makes it convenient for gaining access to the insides. Its rear facet looks somewhat attractive considering its sides, all thanks to its stylish taillight cluster. The tailgate also has a decent structure and is decorated with models lettering along with brand's insignia. To enhance more safety to this facet, its windscreen is accompanied with a third brake light.\n\nExterior Measurements:\n\nIf we go through the external dimensions of this van, we will certainly feel surprised and gets the doubt, whether if it is really an eight seater. This van measures just about 3798mm in its overall length and 1540mm in total width. Its wheelbase figures should leave you in a shock, since it is just 1950mm. The only good thing about its exteriors is its height of 1922mm, which is nearly equal to its overall wheelbase.The no-nonsense part about this four wheeler is its internal cabin. Once we go through the design, we will get an idea about the amount of importance it received from the maker. They have ensured basic essentials inside like storage units, charging point and other utilities to fulfill the requirements of passengers. One should talk about the seating arrangement, which is its plus point. Its cabin looks quite spacious from inside and it can accommodate a maximum of eight passengers. Its cockpit has seating for two while the rear cabin houses six adults. The rear cabin has two bench seats facing each other, creating more leg space for the occupants. This facility is available only for base and mid range trims. While the top end trim has seating option only for five adults. This vehicle gets sliding doors, which allows passengers to gain access to the cabin effortlessly. The interior is in a dual tone color scheme, which is another interesting factor of this vehicle. Going into further details, it has a distinctive instrument cluster featuring several gauges and meters to keep the driver informed. Its dashboard houses a glove box along with equipment like an AC unit. The steering wheel looks pretty simple with just two spokes and its grace is further amplified by the brand's insignia. Its floors are in brown color scheme, giving a plush appeal to the insides.\n\nInterior Comfort:\n\nLike mentioned above, this van from M&M is currently available in three variants. Among those, LX is the base version that has limited number of features. It lacks basic essentials like an AC unit, power steering and utility boxes that only adds to the traveling woes. However, it houses few facilities like a digital clock, cabin lamps at front and rear, a 12V mobile charging point and grab handles. Some of the other features in the list includes magazine map pockets and sun visors for both front passengers. The next-in-line VX 5-seater trim also has same set of features, but additionally, it gets a multi utility box as standard. Moving on to the top end trim, it is equipped with a heating, ventilation and an air conditioning unit that helps to reduce maximum discomfort that is caused while traveling. But disappointingly, the AC vents are present only in the front cabin. Apart from this, it additionally comes with a color coded interior along with bottle holders in central console. The mid range VX and top-of-the line ZX trims have electric power assisted steering system, which is helpful to reduce stress and efforts required to handle this van.\n\nInterior Measurements:\n\nThe official brochure from the maker has no details with regards to the interior measurements, but we can see that it has good space. Like mentioned above, it can offer accommodation to a maximum of eight passengers along with space for luggage storage as well. It is also accompanied with a fuel tank that has a storage capacity of 33 litres.It would be biased to expect this van to be good at acceleration and pickup. Its power figures, weight and capacity does explain that this is a vehicle intended solely for transportation purpose. As a matter of fact, this van doesn't even reach a top speed of 100 Kmph, since its ability is limited to just about 95 Kmph. Hence, the pickup figures wont make much of a difference in this case.Powering this latest model is the 0.9-litre diesel engine, which is also performing duties in other CV models of the company. It is being tuned to draw more power from the thrusters, eventually compensating for its weight. It is a two cylindered mill integrated with a direct fuel injection technology for maximized output. This oil-burner with full thrust can generate a maximum power of 45bhp at 3750rpm and releases a torque of 98Nm between 1600 to 3000rpm. Its transmission duties are handled by a conventional 5-speed manual gearbox.Looking at the size of its engine, one would expect better mileage from this Van. However, its power to weight ratio and outdated direct fuel injection technology are the factors that are tarnishing its fuel efficiency figures. As for the company's claim, this vehicle comes with an efficiency to deliver a maximum mileage of 23.5 kmpl.The 909cc diesel mill is made to pull heavy weights. We can see the same oil-burner under the hood of Maxximo commercial truck and other CV's designed by the company. However, this 2-cylinder based mill has been tuned to churn out better power. As we can see the details, it produces 45bhp that results in a torque output of 98Nm.This vehicle scores nil with regards to the entertainment factor, since there is no CD player, nor at least FM/AM radio tuner. Customers have to depend on the vast accessory market, where they can find a number of such gadgets at a reasonable price. They can equip it with a 2-DIN music player along with speakers. Also they can opt for a touchscreen infotainment system that adds more excitement to the passengers inside. Besides equipment, one can also opt for styling factors like leather seats, floor carpets, alloy wheels, and other features that can give a new look to this van.This is one section, where it scores big as compared to others. This van, unlike other contenders, has got vacuum assisted hydraulic braking system with auto adjuster that provides maximum control over the van. Adding to this, its front wheels are mated with discs and the rear ones are assembled with drums for superior braking mechanism. As for suspension, its front axle is loaded with McPherson struts that further have coil springs. While the rear axle is being fitted with leaf spring type of suspension for maximized comfort while traveling. Its steering is another factor that reduces the efforts of handling this van.This four wheeler is built with the company's robust design, which is tough and rugged. This eventually gives it the capability to tackle the collision impact and to provide safety to the occupants inside. Its unique front nose design is another factor that enhances the safety levels. This vehicle is associated with a few other safety features like child safety locks, seatbelts, halogen lamps, rear reflectors and a high mount third brake light.This entry level van is being fitted with a set of standard 13 inch steel rims mated with full wheel covers. These wheels are further wrapped with 155/80 R13 sized radial tubeless tyres for better grip on roads.1. Presence of wide service network is its biggest advantage.\n\n2. Fuel smart technology helps to reduce fuel consumption.\n\n3. Its price range is quite reasonable.\n\n4. Cabin space and seating option adds to its advantage.\n\n5. Attractive warranty is its plus point.1. Absence of music system is a drawback.\n\n2. There is a need to improve its exterior structure.\n\n3. Comfort features are too little.\n\n4. Its wheelbase is shorter than a hatchback.\n\n5. Its safety section lacks basic features."

This need is addressed by the car maker by incorporating bottle holders and magazine pockets in all doors, a mobile charging socket to the middle row, 2 front and 2 rear cup holders, foldable snack tray and storage under driver seat.

A total height of 1880mm is quite a height to make it appear big. Ground clearance of 180mm is not very impressive for Indian roads, especially not for utility vehicles. It is also bestowed with a minimum turning circle radius of 5.4 meters.Cabin is furbished with a lot of features. Seven occupants can be seated in three rows. First row have captain seats, second row is a bench seat and then the third row has two seats that face each other.

The chassis and braking sections fortify its speed capacity, enabling a more balanced overall build. The recently rolled out new variant in the series, the V10 Plus, comes with some add-ons to the power and vision of the original version, and we're here to seeExteriors:Here is a vehicle with an exterior cover that's nearly hypnotising. We've got to be frank with you, folks, the machine's looks place it in the same platform as models of Ferrari and Lamborghini. The sports-car realm has soaked in all of the finest design elements over years, but this model seems to have veered off the conventional, over-saturated path and tested new grounds with the body designing. The vehicle does bear influences resonating from the mainstream sports models, but you can't deny it has its own unique spark that make it nearly jaw dropping. From the low, sharp front nose to the powerful rear, the machine has been shaped with a grace and elegance that make it almost seductive. The roofline gently streams over the cabin area, before angling in towards the bonnet and merging into it. That agile, powerful stance gives it a formidable air that few vehicles released on Indian roads have seen before. The front face has been shaped with a predator-like vision, with the sharp headlamp clusters and the large front grille that drapes down towards the bottom of the skirt. Air openings hang on both corners of the skirts, giving the face a more harmonious outlook. The bonnet slopes downwards with a flawless precision, and we thought that the strong curvatures mixed a feminine touch in the vehicle's masculine appeal. The gentle metallic skin of the front cloaks over the wheel arches by the side, giving them a more pronounced and muscular appearance. As we stood by the side of the vehicle, we were taken by the low and sharp layout of the vehicle. The note of harmony in its design is clearly visible, and its agile, streamlined poise gives it a honed aerodynamic edge very rarely seen before. We thought that the single door format added to its athletic posture, while the large, black garnish at the rear makes for a more distinct impression. The rear commands a more dynamic aura, with the more husky bearing and the air blades beneath the tail-lamps. The roof-line melts down towards the rear and shapes around a strong section, and we thought that the aesthetics of the design here were particularly good. The slender tail-lamps are positioned atop the air blades, giving a wholesome, intact impression of the region. A short spoiler solidifies the vehicle's powerful impression. When you take a look at the sporty double exhaust pipes situated on both corners of the rear bumper, you feel the car's thrilling image come full circle. Interiors:It's no secret that the cabin lacks space and splendour: It has been tailored solely for the purpose of a safe high speed drive. We did, however, enjoy some plush elements of design that helped to renew the atmosphere. This new edition comes with some minor changes, including the bucket seats and a more attractive, uncluttered dashboard layout. Though the changes are not substantial, we thought that they did add some vitality to the air. When you step into the cabin, you can clearly tell that this is a completely driver oriented cabin, and that pretty much everything else takes a back seat in the design. The all black interiors make for a charged aura, and we thought that it reflected the car's focussed, racy outlook. AC vents sit by the corner of the dashboard. The new version comes with a 12.3-inch virtual screen that has buttons propped around it. At the base of the console, the metallic gear shifter makes adds a more sophisticated pulse to the atmosphere. The steering wheel by the left of the dashboard inherits a classic, racing style design that really had us going. The hold of the wheel was perfect, and few people would deny the thrill of it. Aligned ahead of the wheel, the instrument cluster houses a tachometer and a speedometer, and we thought the dial design was quite cool. Meanwhile, the seats have an all new 'bucket' design. You can feel yourself wrapped in comfortably during the drive, so much so that the thrust of the high speed drive doesn't bother you much. For this new edition, customers are given the choice between Alcantara, Pearl Nappa leather upholstery and fine Nappa leather upholstery to dress the seats. In addition to this, clear coated carbon fibre appliqu\xc3\xa9s can also be added to enrich the space, and we're sure that most occupants would love such small touch-ups. Performance:This is the facet that defines this vehicle. Its raw and electric performance capacity far outstrips most other vehicles on the road. For this version, there is no change with the engine and inner dynamics. Packed within it is a 5.2-litre V10 engine that displaces a mammoth 5204cc. Aside from this, it brings out a thundering power of 602bhp at 8250rpm. Above the figures, it's the driving of the vehicle that would really get you crackling. A light touch on the gas pedal, and the vehicle zooms off to a powerful start. Acceleration and throttle response are amazing, and the swift sprinting capacity had us thrown back into our seats. As you cruise at higher speeds, you're sure to love the majestic sound of the V10 engine grinding. The engine power is transmitted through a highly efficient 7-speed S-tronic gearbox, which worked terrific in our opinion. The vehicle's speed capacity would send chills down an ordinary person's spine: It   roars to a top speed of 330kmph, and spurts from 0 to 100kmph in just 3.2 seconds, the time taken for a few blinks of the eye. Ride and Handling:A vehicle of this might requires equally strong chassis and braking systems, and the company sees to this. The front wheels come with 8-piston brake callipers, while the rear wheels are equipped with 4-piston callipers. We thought that cornering, braking and stopping were a marvellous and strain free affair. With the massive speeds that the car takes to, however, you're likely to be thrown around slightly during swift cornering. The vehicle tackles road anomalies moderately, but one needs to note that it has been designed for high speed cruising on clean raceways, not bumbling over potholes and road bumps. Its advanced suspension arrangement includes dynamically tuned springs and shock absorbers, and this does help to ease the overall ride condition. Safety:With a top speed of 330kmph and a acceleration rate of 3.2 seconds, the vehicle's most pivotal factor is its safety facilities. We were satisfied with the safety layout, although we did think it could have gone a notch or two up. Drive stability is reinforced with some sound aid programs, including the Anti-lock braking system, Electronic differential lock system, Anti slip regulation and Electronic stabilisation control. Aside from this, you're sure to have your fill of peace with an all encompassing airbag arrangement, an integrated head restraint system, seatbelts that come with a reminder for the front occupants and ISOFIX child seating anchors. Variants:Here in India, the model is released with just one variant, the V10 Plus. We think this might spare a lot of hassle to buyers in terms of choosing which variant to go for. This trim comes with a slew of good features, including a reversing camera, a cruise control function, Audi exclusive floor mats, an Audi phone box, and a garage door opener. A Bang & Olufsen sound system brings you first class entertainment, and this comes along with 13-high performance loudspeakers and a 16 channel amplifier for the most engrossing experience possible. Verdict:This car here is a monster. It has been designed to break barriers on the road, and to raise the bar for your high speed experience. On the downside, however, it comes with a small and cramped cabin, its fuel economy could prove very expensive for you, and there are minimal comfort and entertainment facilities to ride with. And to top it all off, you have a whopping price to live with. At the end of the day, this is a one of a kind vehicle, and we'd say its suits a small niche of race enthusiastic people. For those looking for a normal vehicle that they could use in their daily lives, we'd recommend you to look elsewhere. "

sS'Chevrolet Trailblazer'
p147
S"Introduction:The SUV segment has seen quite a boom in India in the recent past. New launches from various brands sizzle the market every now and then. The Chevrolet Trailblazer is a real ladder on frame SUV unlike crossovers that have flooded the market like the Renault Duster, Hyundai Creta and many others. The Trailblazer comes out as a replacement to the widely unpopular Captiva. Can the Trailblazer turn things around for Chevrolet, not only in this segment, but in India as a whole? Let's find out!Pros:1. Large cabin space. First two rows are particularly comfortable. Third row is not too bad either with a roomy atmosphere, adjustable headrests and 3 point seatbelts. 2. Torque! 500 Nm is a figure that is unheard of, even in a segment above it. 3. Impressive feature list: projector headlamps, projector foglamps, touchscreen infotainment system etc.Cons:1. Available only in one trim level. Significantly more expensive than an equivalent Fortuner and Endeavour.2.No manual transmission. Lazy automatic gearbox isn\xe2\x80\x99t too great either.3. No 4x4/AWD variant. Toyota Fortuner and the Ford Endeavour have a 4x4 variant.Stand-Out Features:1. Class-leading 253mm of ground clearance. Endeavour = 225mm | Fortuner = 220mm2. Amongst the biggest cars in its class. Dominating road presence comes standard.Overview:The Trailblazer is Chevrolet\xe2\x80\x99s replacement for the age-old Captiva. While the Captiva sunk without a trace, the Trailblazer wants to go straight for Fortuner\xe2\x80\x99s jugular. It does the basics i.e big size, big list of features and space for 7. Let\xe2\x80\x99s delve deep into the Chevy\xe2\x80\x99s bag of tricks.Exteriors:Its large and masculine presence is balanced out by plush elements. The Trailblazer plays the size-card very well. From the outside, it looks every bit a macho SUV should.Now, getting into the finer details, the front is dominated by a powerful dual port radiator grille. A large Golden Bowtie like Chevrolet logo and some chrome accents complete the massive grille. The pullback headlamps makes for a more aggressive look at the front. The foglamps are tucked away in the lower half of the bumper. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t the usual halogen fogs, but a proper projector setup. They get a dollop of chrome too.The commanding aura of the front, we thought, came from the hefty position of the bonnet, and the sleek design lines add to this effect.By the side, the wheel arches are beefed up for a more prominent look, but you would notice some considerable space between the wheels and the surrounding skin. The 18 inch, 6-spoke alloy wheels don\xe2\x80\x99t look too bad. That said, bigger wheels would have definitely filled in the wheel wells better. The profile on the Chevy is more or less slab-sided. Just a couple of clean creases run across its length to break the sheer bulk of sheet metal. The large windows, chunky door handles and the roof-rails tie up the profile really well.The rear is rather clean. The large wrap around tail-lamps have a hint of the previous generation Toyota Fortuner to them. However, the rear 3/4th is possibly the best angle to view the big Chevy in.The dimensions, in our opinion, are quite appropriate. With a length of 4878mm, a width of 1902mm and a height of 1838mm, it surpasses its closest visual competitors, the Fortuner and Hyundai Sante Fe, in every respect. It also boasts a class leading wheelbase of 2845mm, which also beats its near rivals.Interiors:The cabin is large, spacious and very comfortable. The assortment of fine materials, garnishes and highlights are straight from the top-shelf. Quality, although better than the Fortuner isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the league of the new Endeavour. The visual aesthetic of the inside is pretty much close to what the industry norms are in the segment. The top half of the dashboard is coloured in black, while the lower half is beige for a diversified effect.The centre console gets a glossy piano black finish, and we felt that it looked just perfect. The console houses a 7-inch touchscreen unit that Chevrolet calls \xe2\x80\x98My-Link\xe2\x80\x99. It does support all possible input formats and the audio quality is decent too. However, it does miss out on Satellite Navigation, something that is present on the Endeavour as an option.The buttons of the HVAC controls are placed in a circular layout beneath the audio system, and at the centre is a screen displaying the temperature. Our favorite bit however is the rotary knob that surrounds the screen. The chrome finished knob controls the temperature - a cool touch! Integrated at the bottom of the console are two 12V power sockets, along with buttons for the Traction Control and Hill Descent Control.The chrome plated gear lever brings just enough glitz for any ordinary day, and most passengers would love it. Expect this to get scratched over time (due to rings, other jewellery) though.The steering wheel is just the right design - feels nice to hold. But we personally found the wheel to be a little too close to the driver's chest.On the right side the steering wheel hosts buttons for audio and phone, while on the left, cruise control settings are present. It feels rather comfortable over time. At the front, the instrument cluster houses the speedometer and tachometer in two separate capsules, and at the centre, you have a cluster that displays fuel usage, speed, battery, battery health and many more vital features.The Camaro-inspired design of the dials, along with the vapour-blue illumination looks super-cool, but ever so slightly out of place in an SUV.Storage space for 1L bottles have been carved out in all doors, and we noted that they are not quite as shallow as the door side pockets generally seen in other vehicles. Coming to the interior arrangement, the seats have been ergonomically placed.. The high-quality leather makes the cabin a premium place to be in. However, it would be a hassle to keep it clean. The wide black armrest comes with contrasting white stitching, and is wide enough for both front passengers. The mid row is well spaced, and the seats were larger than we expected. Every passenger gets a neatly incorporated headrest too! An exceptional feature that we observed here was the foldable second row, which can be neatly halved and then tucked away, leaving far more room for the rear row occupants. They however cannot be moved forward to accommodate taller occupants on the third row. Performance:Turn the key and the 2.8 litre engine sputters to life with noise and clatter like typical diesel motor. While the clatter is evident on the outside, the cabin manages to cut the noise off really well. Once past the initial turbo lag, the 500 Nm of gut-wrenching torque hits you in one whack. If you do plant the right foot hard down, you will be grinning - that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure! The engine can cruise extremely comfortably. 100km/h is dealt with at a lazy 1500rpm - the engine can do this all week long if required! Ride and Handling:-The front arm of the suspension has a double wishbone independent mechanism, while the rear has been compounded with a 5-link coil spring. We were happy to notice very little bumps and jerks, and really impressed us in the way it tackled the brutal conditions of Indian roads. Compared to the Fortuner, this model has a slightly softer suspension set-up, and as a result, you're likely to lose resilience at high speeds when driving over some lanky potholes. The passengers in the third row would be uncomfortable at higher speeds, regardless of the road condition. But we've got to say that the ride feels balanced and steady at almost all speeds. In a car of this size, body roll is obvious and expected, but it's not the type or the scale where passengers would feel frightened. In any case, stitching corners should not be on your agenda whilst driving the Trailblazer. Safety:The safety department is upto the mark with airbags, seat belts that come along with pre-tensioners, a warning for the driver's seat belt and ISOFIX child seat anchor points. A strong level of stability is enforced with a brake assistance program, together with traction control. Variants:The model comes in only one variant, which is the LTZ 2WD AT. But the company has loaded it to the brim, all features which one would desire. This includes a theatre dimming effect for the map lamp and centre lamps, illuminated vanity mirror, a driver-side armrest that comes along with a storage box, power steering, and a rear view camera that comes with a 7-inch display. All of this and more is sure to imbue this sole variant with the most polished aura possible.Verdict:At the end of the day, the vehicle has its own set of 'wow' factors. But you're going to have to put up with a fair share of turn-offs too. The Trailblazer does seem like a nice alternative to the Toyota Fortuner. If you need a big and comfortable SUV and do not intend on going off-road ever, the Trailblazer fits the bill rather well. "

S"This company in India is a popular automaker that is known for offering stylish and luxury vehicles. It is a fully owned subsidiary of German car maker and established itself in all over the world. Most of their models have mighty engines are developed to produce an impressive performance on our road conditions.

sS'Datsun GO Plus'
p151
S"Introduction: Since its revival in March 2014, Datsun has launched 4 models (GO, GO+, mi-Do & on-Do) across 4 markets (India, Indonesia, South Africa & Russia) and started production at 3 plants in 3 countries (India, Indonesia & Russia). Quite symmetrical we must say! However in India, we only have two Datsuns as of now in our market. GO was the first one that made its way here and GO+ was launched few months after that.The GO+ is a compact alternative to the larger MPVs as well as a larger alternative to the regular hatchbacks. The company quotes GO+ as an 'estate / station wagon' that offers 5+2 seating. But it wouldn't be out of place to call it a 5-seater with a large boot (vis-a-vis an optional 7-seater MPV).Pros: 1. The only car in its price range to offer a third row. It can accommodate a total of 7 passengers. All other options in the price range are 5 seater hatchbacks.2. The third row can be folded down to be used as a large 347 liter boot. 3. Has a few upmarket features like the Follow me Headlamps, a comprehensive Multi Information Display, Gear Shift Indicator and Speed Sensitive Wipers which are offered right from the base trim. Cons: 1. Bare basic features on offer. Even on the top end variant you don\xe2\x80\x99t get a proper infotainment system.2. Cost cutting has led to compromise not only on the feature list but also the safety. 3. The Datsun brand is new t the Indian market and the image that it has generated around it is negative. Both in terms of safety & quality. 4. Datsun utilizes Nissan\xe2\x80\x99s after sales network which lacks reach. Stand Out Features: 1. Very high claimed fuel economy of over 26 kmpl. The highest of a 7 seater MPV. The figure is high when compared to its hatchback competitors as well. 2. Practicality of a 7 seater in a nifty size under 4 meters.  Exteriors:The Go+ is basically a Go with extra space in the rear \xe2\x80\x93 so when seen head on, it looks exactly like the hatch counterpart. Everything from the hexagonal grille with a black honeycomb mesh, the V in the bonnet to the angular headlamps with metal inserts and the windscreen are identical. We\xe2\x80\x99ve always like the simple yet effective design of the Go, thus a thumbs up for the Go + as well. In profile, the Go+ forces you to believe how small a 7-seater(5+2 to be precise) can get. From outside, the Datsun Go+ can easily pass of as a mini-estate having a bulbous rear attached to the Go hatchback. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like an afterthought add-on job like we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on some compact-sedans in market currently and looks very well fused.Side profile of the GO+ is an angle from which you can figure out that this is a wagon, at least aspires to be one. Despite being a 7-seater, the GO+ doesn't have a large footprint. Thanks to the difference of only 210 mm between the GO and GO+. Also, the width and wheelbase are the same. So, don\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to do an Ertiga or Mobilio for you.We didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the huge wheel well gaps that are glorified by the tiny 155/70 R13 tyres. If not 15\xe2\x80\x99, at least 14\xe2\x80\x99 tyres should have been there. At the rear, this gap exposes everything from the fuel tank, suspension to the exhaust pipe assembly.As we stated in the starting, this is basically a stretched Go, therefore Datsun has pulled the bumper further back \xe2\x80\x93 so the rear overhang is quite prominent. The tailgate is extremely light; in fact it\xe2\x80\x99s the lightest unit we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. There isn't a separate keyhole or lever for opening the boot \xe2\x80\x93 that has to be unlocked only through the driver's side release.The number plate on the Go+ has been moved to the tailgate (Go\xe2\x80\x99s housed on the rear bumper). The rear is clean and the overall styling does look convincing. Overall, the Go+ is a decent looking offering that looks well-proportioned. Interiors:Except the 3rd row, inside of the GO+ is identical to the hatch sibling. The dash and door panels are of 'greige' (mix of grey + beige) colour. Though plastic quality is very basic and just above satisfactory, sturdiness of the panels is a point worth mentioning here.We quite liked the black centre console that looks quite finished and smoother than the rest of the dashboard which carries a grainy texture. Quality of the plastic panels is decent & the GO+ uses the Sunnys-shaped door handles (save for the chrome).The GO+ uses an old school 'stick' type locking knobs, which might remind you of the car in which u learnt driving, but admiring them is a bit difficult. Central locking is available on the top-end variant only.  The roof feels damn flimsy. There's a lot of crunching & crinkling when you push the lining a few inches before hitting the roof. The sun visors have been carried over from the GO and don't get vanity mirrors.The Go+'s wheelbase is longer than most of our hatchbacks. As a result, there\xe2\x80\x99s ample space in both the rows. What we also liked is the decent shoulder and headroom. Ingress and egress is convenient. Corners of the dashboard slope inward, which is boon for older drivers who sit first and then swing their legs. Though, an adjustable steering would have made it very comfortable.GO+\xe2\x80\x99s front seats are 'connected' to each other - like the HM Ambassador. The driver's chair is a conventional one, it's the front passenger's seat that has an extension to fill the gap. Datsun says that area in-between is useful for placing knick knacks & handbags. But we think \xe2\x80\x93it\xe2\x80\x99s not that thoughtful because in case someone tries to sit there(which we\xe2\x80\x99re sure many would), can be risky.The seats feel offers ample comfort and feels more foamy than cushiony. It gets integrated headrests and the seat cushioning remains thin. Knees of the rear occupant can be felt through the seat, which\xe2\x80\x99s annoying on certain occasions.Performance:Petrol: The compact MPV is powered by the familiar 3-cylinder, 1.2-liter petrol from the GO & Micra Active hatchbacks. It churns out the same 67 BHP @ 5000 rpm & 104 Nm of torque @ 4000 rpm. The ARAI puts its fuel economy at 20.62 kmpl that\xe2\x80\x99s just 0.01 kmpl lower than the GO.Despite the same motor churning out the same number of horses as in the Go, that too having an added 20 kilograms to pull, the Go+ doesn\xe2\x80\x99t gives you a chance to complain. The motor has been re-tuned, but the altered ECU tune hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed the eager nature of the three pot mill. Engineers at Nissan have done a great job in enhancing the overall drivability and refinement of the motor.Thanks to its healthy power and torque to weight ratios, Go+\xe2\x80\x99s engine feels quite peppy and the throttle is responsive too. The MPV doesn't feel sluggish, although continuous downshifting helps might irritate you a bit. It\xe2\x80\x99s reasonably quick in a dash to 100 kmph and able to easily attain & sustain 120 kpmh. Though we don\xe2\x80\x99t recommend going over that speed. Period.NVH & Insulation is better than Go hatch, but engine as well as wind noise permeate through the cabin easily. Not just motor's gruff note, you can even hear the exhaust as well, which we found very irritating. The suspension is also noisy, accompanied by excessive tyre noise on bad roads.Ride and Handling:Go+ offers a really pliant ride. Its suspension has been tuned to deal with the greater load at the rear, but seems quite pliant and absorbent overall. The light controls make it very easy to drive within the city and the small turning radius of 4.6 meters is like icing on the cake.The steering is light enough at low speeds, and weighs up when you hit the highway. Like other electronic units, this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel too nervous or unsure at higher speeds.The MPV is not a corner carver and isn\xe2\x80\x99t meant to be one either. Body roll is quite evident during the drive. At higher speeds, the car feels wafty and, on uneven highways, becomes bouncy at the rear.We would recommend upsizing the tyres as the stocks ones are too puny for the GO+. Also, they are produced by an unknown Strada brand. Upgrading them to a 175 size from a reputable manufacturer is what we would suggest.Safety: Safety is one of the biggest concerns with the Go +. When its younger sibling, the Datsun Go, was put through the Global NCAP crash test, the results were dismal. It scored zero stars and the testing authority claimed that even if the Go were to be tested with airbags, the results would bear no difference. The car's structure was just so bad. The Go + is similar to the Go in terms of structure and this is where our concerns lie. Datsun had to trade off a features to keep the costs in check and safety seems to have taken the biggest brunt. While the Go + is sold with an optional driver airbag, we highly recommend looking for a safer alternative. Variants: The feature list of the Datsun Go +, even on the top end variant is small. The Go + is offered in a total of 5 trim levels. The base trim (D) gets a few stand out features like the follow me home lamps and 3rd row seats. However, the airconditioning is available only on the next (A) trim. You do miss out on power steering here which is offered on the A (ESP) variant. ESP standing for electronic power steering. The one with an AUX input with 4 speakers media system and phone dock is found on the (T) trim. The AUX is the only option for your media requirements as there is no option for a USB, CD or Bluetooth input. The USB on offer is only for charging your device.  Along with this, the (T) trim offers power windows. The only safety feature on offer is a driver side airbag on the top end T (O). We highly recommend opting for this variant. Verdict:Though Datsun insists on calling it a seven-seater, the Go+ isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a proper one. The third row can only accommodate luggage and can't really be used to seat any adult. But if you look at it as a five-seater, with a decent amount of luggage space, then the Go+ makes more sense."

It is now capable of producing a peak power of 134.10bhp at 3600 to 4400rpm and yields a pounding torque output of 250Nm between 1600 to 3000rpm.Editor's take : The mileage is decent, and buyers of vehicles like B-Class might not be too much worried about the fuel economy. The diesel returns about 17 km/l on the highway, if you decided to cruise at 80-90 km/hr, it should return even more.Its diesel engine received a minor update, but its fuel efficiency remains to be unchanged.

The plastic quality isn\xe2\x80\x99t that impressive and we wish that the Vibe offered a few more bells and whistles too. The interiors are done up very elegantly with well placed features, which makes it look like a complete package of comfortableness.

The rear windscreen is fitted with a defogger that is helpful in foggy climate.\n\nInterior Measurements:\n\nOwing to a massive wheelbase, the cabin is very spacious. Good head space enables even tall occupants to seat conveniently. Shoulder space and leg room is quite good and avoids friction between occupants. A boot space of 510 litres is very good for planning long trips. A fuel tank capacity of 50 litres is also advantageous.Ed's take: It isn\xe2\x80\x99t the acceleration that is the USP of this engine, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the drivability. A 5-speed manual transmission gear box is mated to this mill. It has a displacement capacity of about 1461cc. Along with the ability to reach a top speed of 145 to 150 Kmph, it can also breach the 100 Kmph mark in about 17.2 seconds.Ed's take: The drivability of the Verito Vibe is excellent. Lug in into a higher gear and there is no struggle from the oil burner. A 1.5-litre diesel mill is incorporated that runs based on a common rail direct injection fuel supply system and produces a good mileage. About 21.03 Kmpl can be expected on highways and in the cities, this can come down to only 18.01 Kmpl. There are four cylinders and eight valves which comprises of about 1461cc displacement. These are arranged based on a single overhead camshaft valve configuration. This mill has a capacity to generate a maximum power of 65bhp at 4000rpm and also a peak torque of 160Nm at 2000rpm. It is skilfully mated to a 5-speed manual transmission gear box and this motor can accelerate to a top speed of 145 \xe2\x80\x93 150 Kmph. It can reach from 0 to 100 Kmph within 16 to 17 seconds, which is quite good.Ed's take: The Verito Vibe comes only in diesel engine, and it gets the K9K engine that is highly frugal.This oil burner is based on a common rail direct injection fuel supply system and is efficient enough in delivering a decent mileage. On highways, it can stretch up to 21.03 Kmpl, whereas, when driven in the city traffic conditions, this figure minimizes to 18.01 Kmpl.Ed's take: The power produced by this engine on paper isn\xe2\x80\x99t that great, but in real world it does the job. Its mill has four cylinders which further have eight valves and can generate a maximum power of 65bhp at 4000rpm and a peak torque output of 160Nm at 2000rpm.Ed's take: The Verito Vibe gets music system with USB and aux connectivity to it.

It also has voice alert system that helps the driver to give commands without taking hands off the steering wheel. Customer can further customize the car by equipping accessories as per requirement from authorized dealers at an additional cost.Ed's take: The ride of the Verito Vibe is plush as it built on the Logan\xe2\x80\x99s suspension, which is very good. Most of the shocks from the road are soaked up by the suspension and even the handling is decent. An anti lock braking system along with an electronic brake-force distribution are equipped in this series. This braking mechanism will avoid locking of the brakes and also will allow to have greater grip on all kinds of roads. Front wheels are fixed with a pair of disc brakes whereas a standard set of drum brakes are integrated to the rear wheels. When it comes to the suspension, the front axle has a McPherson strut with wishbone link. On the other hand, the rear axle consists of a H section torsion beam along with a programmed deflection coil spring. A minimum turning radius of 5.25 meters is helpful in the handling. Driver's effort is reduced as well as efficiency is increased by a responsive power assisted steering wheel.Ed's take: The Verito Vibe gets active safety features like ABS, which helps in controlled braking. The passive safety features include airbag and seatbelts for all five occupants. An airbag is provided to the driver in the high end trim. This will safeguard from head and chest injuries in case of a crash. Its steering wheel is collapsible and can be tilt adjusted as well. This feature will let the steering wheel to collapse and thus when an accident occurs, the wheel won't stick into the driver's chest resulting in a fatal injury and additionally will make room for the airbag to deploy.

The latest upgrades are additional features which are limited only to its top-spec Highline grade. Aside from that, it receives no changes on the exterior, technical or interior front. One of the new aspects on board is the mirror link connectivity that will reflect your phone's screen onto the audio unit display. Another feature is the rain sensor, which is now integrated to the auto dimming IRVM. Safety wise, it carries the same attributes that were present in the outgoing model. Some of them include electronic engine immobilizer, electronic stabilization program, and three point seat belts as well. On the other hand, three engine options are on offer to choose from. Of which, two are petrol and the other one is a diesel motor. All these are tuned to deliver exceptional performance on roads besides making good power and torque output. In this segment, it locks horns with other best sellers in the market like Honda City, Hyundai Verna and Maruti Ciaz. The next offering from this brand will be the Ameo, which is all set for its debut in the Auto Expo 2016. It is likely that this new model will carry most of the elements that are present in the Vento.Background & EvolutionVolkswagen India had started the production of Vento in 2010 in its Pune plant. It was introduced in three trim levels \xe2\x80\x93 Trendline, Comfortline and Highline. This model is technically, a stretched version of its hatchback sibling Volkswagen Polo. Even then, it was offered with both petrol and diesel engine options. The firm went on to add a separate TSI model with a 1.2-litre TSI motor that was borrowed from the Polo. This sedan managed to impress many with features like automatic climate control and a touchscreen radio to name a few. In 2013, the manufacturer came up with the \xe2\x80\x9cStyle\xe2\x80\x9d limited edition trim and next, it was the \xe2\x80\x9cKonekt Edition\xe2\x80\x9d in 2014. Meanwhile, the model received a facelift in 2015 with some changes made to its interiors, and exteriors. This year's facelift brings it some additional aspects, which have been missing in all its predecessors.ExteriorVento has always been a smart sedan, which owns a design that is both elegant and stylish. The 2016 version does not receive any changes to its outsides. However, it carries some attractive elements that make it a head turner on roads.In terms of dimensions, its rival Maruti Ciaz is 100mm longer and 31mm wider than Volkswagen Vento. As for the height, all its competitors are ahead of Vento. Even the ground clearance and wheelbase measurements are less than all other models.On the front, the first thing to catch your attention is definitely the wide radiator grille featuring three horizontally positioned slats. What highlights it further is the attractive logo, which sits exactly at the center of the grille. The neat chrome finishing to thin slats as well as insignia makes it look more striking.The black finished halogen headlamps on either side of the grille is another element thats worth mentioning. Being large in size, its headlight cluster fits well with the design of its grille. In the mid and top spec trims, dual beam headlamps are also on the offer.Made of a heat insulating glass, its windscreen now gets rain sensing wipers thus, making the view more clear ahead. Talking about the bonnet, it slopes downward, while the minimal creases which gives it an appealing look.Nothing much to describe in its side profile except for the 15-inch Zirkonia alloy wheels that come adorned with high performance tubeless tyres of size 185/60 R145. Tubeless tyres of same size are used for the Comfortline grade as well. While the rest of the lineup gets robust steel rims, which are sized 14 inches in the Trendline trims. These radial tubeless tyres bear the size 175/70 R14.Well designed outside rear view mirrors are also on the list, which gets neat body color. Side turn indicators are given as standard in all the variants.This sedan does look plain and lacks some style in its rear end however, a few aspects make it somewhat interesting to look at.The taillight cluster is quite bright and comes integrated with 3D effect lamps along with turn indicators.The bumper in its rear end is neatly carved, while the boot lid is embossed with company's insignia and gives a good impression to the on-lookers.Coming to its boot compartment, it measures around 494 liters, which is indeed enough for placing a number of bags. However, Honda and Maruti are comparatively better in this point as, they are offering more luggage storage space than Vento.InteriorThe design of its internal section is left untouched in this facelift, however, some advanced equipments can be seen inside, adding to its features list. The cabin is neat good quality plastic materials and has space for five people who can feel convenient with ample head, leg as well as shoulder room.Inside the car, you can actually see the excellent work of the company's designers who have combined the dual tone color scheme and chrome elements to give it an elegant look. Especially, if you take a look at the dashboard, it looks so well designed and even the equipments are properly positioned thus, making it more convenient for the driver to control different functions with much ease.A stylish center console sits at the center of the dashboard carrying aspects like the climatronic automatic air conditioning unit with rectangular shaped air vents, which are placed just above the music system. Dust, pollen filter and rear AC vent is also available.Undoubtedly, one of the important updates it has received is the dynamic infotainment display. This advanced unit is offered with a touchscreen display and also includes radio, navigation system and a few other functions. Meanwhile, the mirror link connectivity is definitely an add-on that lets you connect your phone to the car and access different functions effortlessly.A power assisted steering column is on offer with tilt and telescopic adjustment functions that aid the driver in adjusting its position accordingly. Exactly behind it is a stylish instrument cluster that also holds a tachometer, tripmeter, as well as speedometer.PerformanceDieselThe diesel versions have a 1.5-litre turbocharged oil burner that is based on a DOHC valve configuration. This engine makes a peak power of 103.5bhp besides yielding torque of 250Nm. Here, the added benefit is the availability of both 5-speed manual and 7-speed DSG automatic transmission gear box options. Also, it gives a good mileage of about 20.64 Kmpl in the manual trims, while this figure is even better in the AT variants where the fuel economy comes to 21.5 Kmpl approximately.PetrolThe naturally aspirated 1.6-litre petrol engine is one among the two options offered in this model. It produces 103.5bhp and 153Nm torque besides returning a mileage of around 16.09 Kmpl. This one comes with a 5-speed manual transmission gear box. Also on the offer is the 1.2-litre petrol mill, which also generates the same power but delivers torque of 175Nm between 1500 to 4100rpm. This mill is mated with a 7-speed DSG automatic transmission gear box that drives power to its front wheels.Ride and HandlingAs for the braking, a robust set of ventilated disc brakes are fitted to its front wheels and the rear ones get sturdy drum brakes. Anti lock braking mechanism is also offered that not only boosts this mechanism but also prevents the vehicle from skidding. Meanwhile, the McPherson strut on front axle and semi-independent trailing arm on the rear one makes your journey in this sedan quite comfortable. This suspension system ensures the ride is smooth no matter how the road conditions are. On the other hand, with a speed sensing electronic power steering column, you can easily take turns besides having good control at both low and high speeds.SafetySafety elements are up to the mark in this upgraded Vento. In the entry level models, you will find aspects like dual front airbags, three point seat belts that are height adjustable at front, and electronic engine immobilizer with floating code. The rear parking sensors does the job of alerting the driver about any obstacle through audible signals, while the front and rear adjustable head restraints offers support and protection to your neck. Whereas the mid and top spec variants additionally gets hill hold control, and power windows with pinch guard function on all doors. Besides these, the advanced attributes like anti lock braking system as well as electronic stabilization program takes the security standards to next level.VariantsThis model series is presently offered in three trim levels.Its base level Trendline trim does have an array of features, which are quite good for the price range it carries. Key elements like a multi function display, driver seat with adjustment facility and sporty flat-bottom steering wheel are present in this model.In case of Comfortline variant, you will get to see a few more additional aspects like cruise control, remote central locking, and 15-inch steel rims.The advanced and newly added features are present in the top end Highline trim, which comes with Mirror link connectivity, auto dimming inside rear view mirror, and has steering mounted audio controls as well.VerdictWe at CarDekho, would opine that it is quite disappointing that this facelifted Volkswagen Vento lacks updates to its exteriors, interiors and technical details as well. There is no doubt that with new offerings and improvements, this automaker is continuously putting efforts to raise the standards in the market. But just adding a few new attributes may not impress many buyers keeping in view, the upcoming Auto Expo and considering the new aspects with which all other manufacturers are coming with. However, if the price and performance parameters are prioritized, it may still remain a preferred choice of a certain section of customers. "

sS'Mini Cooper Convertible'
p185
S"When the Mini was conceptualised, they were meant to be small on the outside with decent room on the inside. They were supposed to be easy to drive and cheap to maintain. They were frugal as well. It was everything you needed from  an everyday commuter. Today, the Mini stands at the exact opposite end of the spectrum. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to buy a Mini to grab those eyeballs and to put it bluntly, show off. Is it still the Mini we\xe2\x80\x99ve always adored? We find out. Pros: 1.The 2 litre engine with two turbos spews out 192 horses. Makes the car a true pocket-rocket!  2.The precise feedback from the steering keeps you in control all the time. It\xe2\x80\x99s huge fun on hilly sections and corners too. 3.The suspension is tuned on the stiffer side. This makes its go kart like handling an enthusiast\xe2\x80\x99s delight. Cons: 1.While the stiff suspension is fun on winding roads, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t comfortable  on city roads that are full of and speed breakers. 2.The rear seat space continues to be small and unusable. Best left to kids or luggage. 3.With an on road sticker price of close to INR 50 lakh, there are bigger and more comfortable options in the market. Standouts: 1.The fabric roof folds down in 18 seconds at the flick of a switch. Can be done on the move too, at speeds up to 30km/h.2. Even with the big sticker price, it still is the cheapest convertible you can buy. Exterior: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mini is a modern canvas with old school design elements.\xe2\x80\x9cThe Mini term was coined for a very straight forward reason. They were, well, small. It just isn\xe2\x80\x99t the case with any of the Minis anymore. The Mini continues to retain the same design cues, but for one who\xe2\x80\x99s observed the Mini evolve over the years has seen it grow. Not only in terms of size, but a transformation from a functional car to an expensive toy.The front gets the same characteristic round headlamps and a hexagonal grill finished in chrome. In terms of overall design, the lines are more curvy than they have ever been before. The headlamps are updated with LED DRLs. As the version we drove was the S, it gets the badging in red. The other elements on the front include a Mini Badge and an air scoop.Move to the side, and the center of attraction is the lack of a roof.  The fabric roof  folds away in 18 seconds flat. Neat black cladding skirts the entire length on the side. The rear view mirror gets some optional checkered detailing to bring out the karter in you. At the back, the dual  chrome tip exhaust immediately catch your attention. The tail lamps have a roundish design to go along with the retro theme  and get thick chrome surrounds. A neat strip of glossy black flanks the number plate and gets the Mini logo. The Mini Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s exteriors is basically a modern canvas with old school design cues. It is hard to execute, but we have to admit, Mini has pulled it off. Interiors: \xe2\x80\x9cA retro design that\xe2\x80\x99s functional. Something that you rarely come across.\xe2\x80\x9cThe same design philosophy of modern meets  retro continues on the inside. Almost all elements on the interior run a circular theme. While rounded designs may seem boring, the choice of a black and red interior livens the cabin. Step into the driver's seat and you find a snug fit. The cushioning, side bolstering & lateral support is the best we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen till date. The only drawback, they are not electrically adjustable. Manual seat adjust in a car that costs INR 50 lakh is just not done!  The steering wheel is a chunky unit with neat red-stitch detailing. The ergonomics was evident from the second I placed my hand on this wheel. The optional paddle shifters and the steering mounted buttons are perfectly accessible. The dials have an eclipse design with the large speedo taking center stage. The rev counter peeps out from the side. All other details are displayed on the Multi Information Display on the bottom half of the speedo. The center console houses one of the biggest circular elements in the cabin, other than the steering wheel. It nestles the rectangular multimedia system along with complementing control buttons below it. Move further down and an array of airplane cockpit theme flip switches get individual slots. All of the elements on the center console get chrome bezels that gleefully bounce off sunlight  when the roof is pulled down. The whole dashboard is separated by two red L shape elements with certain elements on the dash get a carbon fiber like pattern. On either ends are circular air vents while the ones adorning the center console are rectangular. Each get an old school knob to control airflow. Between the driver & passenger seat is a touchpad system to control the multimedia system, quite similar to the systems on Mini\xe2\x80\x99s parent company, BMW. The rear is the biggest let down. Even with increased knee-room when compared to the previous edition, the rear is simply not accommodating. This renders the car a 2 seater in our books. The boot too has seen an improvement and now stands at 215 liters. The interior carries a retro charm but is functional. Something that you rarely see go hand in hand. Performance \xe2\x80\x9cReally powerful go-kart. Plaster\xe2\x80\x99s a smile across your face.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Mini Cooper S Convertible comes with a 2.0 litre, twin turbocharged petrol motor. This is mated to a 6 speed steptronic gearbox. The engine spews out 192 horsepower and 280 Nm of toque. That is a lot of power for a car of this size. There are three driving modes on this car. Green, Mid & Sport. Each of these modes doing justice to their names. When in the driving seat, everything works in perfect tandem with each other. The instant throttle response, the quick shifts from the gearbox and the precise steering feedback make this car really fun to drive. The car takes on corners really well with its stiff suspension. We had huge fun thanks to this setup, but when we hit cobbled stretches of road, we wanted something more soft and  comfortable. However, it is very rarely that you can have the best of both worlds. We drove on a test section with a slalom and brake stretch. The brakes bring the car to a halt from 120-0 in 40 meters.

S'IntroductionHyundai Grand i10 was the first car to get the Fluidic Design concept from the company and the car received an amazing response for its pleasing design and a long list of features, some of which are segment firsts. Not just in India, the new Grand i10 or just i10 as known globally has found fans all around the globe. With compact dimensions, spacious interiors, class leading features and frugal engines, it\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that the Hyundai Grand i10 won the 2014 Indian Car of the Year Award.Pros1. Fresh and neat design; will please most and hurt none.\n2. Segment leading features such as rear AC vents, push button start/stop, keyless entry, chilled glove box.\n3. India-spec Grand i10 is longer in length and wheelbase than the Euro-spec, resulting in airy cabin and space.\n4. Conventional handling, comfortable ride quality. Well tuned for Indian roads.Cons1. ABS and Airbags available only in the Top variant as an option.\n2. Non-adjustable front head rests.Stand-out features1. First-in-segment rear AC vents.\n2. Best-in-class build quality.ExteriorHyundai Grand i10 was the first car to introduce the brand\xe2\x80\x99s Fluidic Design concept to the customers in India. The front gets most of the design\xe2\x80\x99s impact with swept back headlamps, hexagonal grille and a pronounced bumper that hosts a nicely designed fog lamps.To the side, things are kept simple with a sharp crease runs the length of the car, joining the door handles on to the tail lamp.The side profile of the Indian Grand i10 has a few changes in comparison to its Euro version. The car is longer by 100 mm in length and has a 40 mm longer wheelbase in the Indian avatar. The rear door and rear windows are larger and with a redesigned C-pillar, making for a spacious rear cabin. A waistline black molding adds safety from scratches apart from the style appeal. The eight spoke alloy wheels look great with the diamond cut finish.To the rear, things are kept simple yet not boring. The wrap-around tail lamps are nicely designed while the rear bumper integrated reflectors add a touch of style and safety.Dimension wise, the Grand i10 may not be as long or as wide as its competitors. The Grand i10 also has the shortest wheelbase with 2425 mm. But this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the Grand i10 is not spacious. In fact, the rear seat of the Grand is one of the most spacious in its segment.The Grand i10 also offers one of the spacious boots in its class with 256 litres. Only the new Ford Figo offers better boot space at 257 litres while Toyota Liva gets close at 251 litres.InteriorsThe Grand i10\xe2\x80\x99s interiors are the best in class in terms of build quality and finish. The quality of the materials used and the way the parts are put together rival the some of the cars in the C segment.Along with a contemporary styling, the black and beige interiors offer amazing quality of materials and a functional layout.While the top and bottom of the interiors get the black layout, the middle gets the beige treatment. All the buttons are of good size and are placed in comfortable positions for use. The front seats snuggle you up nicely with the right amount of cushioning and offer nice thigh support and leg room. While the driver seat height adjustment is a welcome addition, the fixed headrests are a missed opportunity.The steering wheel gets a nice size to hold onto and can be adjusted for tilt but not for reach. The instrument cluster is not your regular two pod layout. Instead you get a big speedometer in the middle with a half-moon tacho to the left and two dials for engine temperature and fuel level to the right. There is also a multi-information display below showing the odometer, two trip meters and gear shift indicator. The steering wheel gets controls for music and telephone.The centre console is a neatly designed arrangement the top of the console hosting the entertainment system with two circular AC vents to either side. The bottom half of the console gets the AC controls with the regular three dial layout. The glove box is large and you can keep your things cool inside the glove box, keeping them fresh away from the heat.At the rear, things further gets better with the first-in-segment rear AC vents, bettering the job of cooling down the cabin faster. The additional 100 mm of length and 40 mm of longer wheelbase that we talked about earlier makes its usefulness in the rear seat space. Three adults can travel in reasonable comfort thanks to lots of legroom and the shoulder room is also commendable. The rear seats can be folded down for additional luggage space but they are not 60-40 split.As with all the Hyundais, the Grand i10 too gets a long list of features with several segment leading ones.The features include rear AC vents, push button start/stop, keyless entry, cooled glove box etc.Surprisingly, climate control is not available and the rear defogger is only available from the Sportz variant.PerformanceThe Grand i10 is available in two engine options - the tried and tested 1.2-litre Kappa Dual VTVT petrol engine and the new 1.1-litre 2nd Gen U2 diesel engine.PetrolThe Grand i10 petrol is powered by a 1.2-litre Kappa Dual VTVT engine putting out 82 bhp at 6000 rpm and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4000 rpm. You get a choice of either a 5-speed manual gearbox or a 4-speed automatic one. The petrol unit is the proven one already powering the regular i10 among others. The engine feels super refined at idle and even when revved to some extent. It\xe2\x80\x99s only when you get closer to red lining it, the engine gets vocal. The engine responses eagerly and has a healthy mid range.On the highways, the unit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel lazy and overtaking is done neatly with just a downshift. The 1.2-litre petrol engine is a rev happy unit and the torque that starts to deliver at low rpms does a good job for city driving. The 5-speed manual does a neat job of slotting gears smoothly.DieselThe new 1.1-litre 2nd Gen U2 diesel engine makes its debut with the Grand i10. The 1.1-litre makes a maximum power of 70 bhp at 4000 rpm and a peak torque of 160 Nm at 1500-2750 rpm. The 3-cylinder may be weaker than most of its competition but its lighter weight should compensate for the performance.  The power delivery is linear and there is no surging like the normal turbo units. The turbo lag is kept to the minimum and the engine pulls off easily from idle.But bring the car to the highways and you will be left wanting for more. The U2 unit loses the fizz very soon close to 3700 rpm and post that, there is no use in revving it up. Overtaking should be planned carefully and if you lose speed, gaining it back will take time. The Grand i10 diesel is well refined from inside the cabin and the gearbox is smooth.Ride and HandlingThe Grand i10 gets a McPherson Strut to the front and coupled torsion beam axle to the rear for its suspension setup. Focus has been largely on the riding comfort more than handling and this shows in the Grand i10 soaking up the bumps with a slight thud. Straight line ability for high speeds is good but around the curves and bends, you will feel the body roll more than you will like.\nBut for most of the part, the Grand i10 handles neutrally without any surprises and without any fun either. The handling of the car is predictable and may put off enthusiasts (who will go for the Swift or the new Figo). The masses will like the ride quality and that will be the USP to take from the Grand i10. The braking duties are performed without any drama once you get used to the sharper bite.SafetyThough the Euro spec Grand i10 gets six airbags, the Indian Grand gets only dual airbags in the front and ABS too but only in the Asta variant as an option. Then there is the rear defogger and reverse parking sensors that is available from the Sportz variant. Other safety features include immobilizer, front fog lamps, day and night inside rear view mirror and central locking.VariantsThe Hyundai Grand i10 is available in five variants for both petrol and diesel versions. The 4-speed automatic version is only available in the Asta variant.The base Era variant gets Engine immobilizer, chrome radiator grille, 2-tone black and beige interior, front and rear door map pockets, tachometer, MID, power steering, manual AC with heater, front power windows, internally adjustable ORVMs.Next in line is the Magna variant which will be one of the best selling variants as it offers most useful features. The Magna gets Central locking, front fog lamps, day and night inside rearview mirror, standard keyless entry, body coloured door mirrors and door handles, full wheel covers, rear power windows, electrically adjustable ORVMs and rear AC vents.The Sportz variant adds Reverse parking sensors, rear defogger, roof rails, turn indicators on ORVMs, metal finish inside door handles, 2-DIN integrated system with Radio, CD, MP3, Aux-in, Bluetooth connectivity, steering wheel controls, electric folding ORVMs and tilt steering.The top end Asta gets Smart key, chrome outside door handles, rear spoiler, clean silver alloy wheels, leather wrapped steering wheel, rear washer and wiper, push button start/stop, driver seat height adjust and adjustable rear seat headrests.If you want to driver and front passenger airbags, ABS and diamond cut alloy wheels, you have to opt for Asta (O).VerdictThe Grand i10 just reiterates how long has Hyundai come to offer better looking cars that offer good driving experience and lots of features.This equation has been unmatched by many manufacturers and there lies Hyundai\xe2\x80\x99s success formula.'

S"Ford EcoSport, the product that changed the face of India's compact SUV segment has went on to receive minor cosmetic updates. Ever since it was first introduced in the year 2013, it has continued to dominate its segment and is still doing so. The newly introduced version is being touted as the 2016 version, which gets modified headlamps, redesigned skid-plates and new set of alloy wheels. The update doesn't end with cosmetics, as it has also spread to the variants portfolio and its features. Though the manufacturer has retained all the existing variants, but has added a new trim to the lineup in the form of Trend+. Along with this, it has renamed the top end Titanium Option as Titanium+. Moving on to the features, all the trims get a new set of features, making them even more desirable. Its entry level trim now gets accessory power sockets and 100 percent foldable rear seat as standard. While the versions from 'Trend' will now get ABS with EBD as standard. On the other hand, its high end product is equipped with new facilities like automatic headlamps, non-LED daytime running lights and an Electrochromatic inside rear view mirror. As for the safety, side and curtain airbags are now available in the Titanium AT version, which takes the security levels to a newer heights.The only disappointing fact about this new version is that its cabin design is carried forward from the outgoing version. Being a sub 4-meter SUV, one would expect it to have a smaller cabin. But its cabin space has surprised everyone, thanks to the engineers efforts to design its interiors with restricted dimensions. In terms of technical specifications, this SUV is still available with three different engine choices. One of those is the critically acclaimed 1.0-litre EcoBoost petrol mill, which is powerful and fuel efficient as well. This mill is now available for selection on two trims like Titanium and Trend+. The other two motors are 1.5-litre Ti-VCT petrol and 1.5-litre TDCi diesel, whose transmission duties are handled by a manual transmission. Among these, the latter one has been tuned to enhance its power output to a 98.59bhp, that eventually contributed towards improvement in its fuel efficiency. Currently, it is leading the compact SUV segment in India with highest number of sales, and the recently launched Mahindra TUV300 hardly creating any impact.The fascinating exterior styling has gone to the next level, thanks to the minor cosmetic tweaks made to it. As we can see, its front profile gets revised headlamps with signature guide lamps. Also there are non-LED daytime running lights placed on the front bumper that amplifies its dynamic stance. This is perhaps the only update given to the front facade. On the sides, its skid plates gets a new new design augmenting its sporty characteristics. The designers have come up with an impeccable job with the overall dimensions and have left no stone unturned to carve it into a sensation. This 5-seater SUV has got a tall stance that makes it more influencing. Its frontage has a wide radiator grille with thick chrome stripe borders that make it look big upfront, while the bold appearing grille has the company emblem resting in the center. The aggressive fa\xc3\xa7ade of this vehicle has massive front bumper with a huge 3-layered air dam. Just alongside the air dam there are attractively carved chrome encircled fog lamps. The angular headlamps are a perfect match up for this kind of phenomenal frontage. The raised hood provides a macho and mature stance to the SUV, while at the sides the huge front wheel fenders align well to the A pillar making it look properly merged. Also the pair of body colored ORVMs with engraved turn indicators makes the most of this appealing suave vehicle. Though the door handles are kept simple, but the striking silver color roof rails manage to enhance the side profile. The wheels are 16-inch alloys and have been kept the same \xe2\x80\x98dazzling' as seen at the display at Auto Expo 2012. The rear has atypical looking C pillar that appears somewhat like the A pillar, which we generally see in SUVs. The rear wind screen glass has integrated spoiler, whereas the bumper comes in semi-black mode making it look wonderful. What's more, the further attraction at rear is the mounted spare wheel at the exquisite tail gate that authorizes it as a proper SUV. The tail lamps are made of clear glass and are stretched to provide the sporty feel of the SUV way till the end corner.Exterior Measurements:The designers at the manufacturer have very astutely carved the exterior of the compact SUV, making it appear no smaller than any SUV on the road. The overall dimensional length is 3999 mm long, while the total width is about 1765 mm. Moreover the height measures a good 1708 mm which is impressive due to its upright nature. The wheel base measures a good 2520 mm alongside a decent ground clearance of 200mm.Ed's take: The interior styling of the Ecosport is similar to that of the Fiesta, with a cockpit like design.It's not at all a hidden fact that one will find anything boring in this SUV, and the flattering plushness inside is a solid proof of the same. As soon as you enter the cabin it's hard to believe that such compact vehicle, as seen from outside, carries this huge space within; courtesy smart interior designers of the manufacturer. The interiors especially the first row has many similarities with the existing Fiesta sedan. The seating position for every individual is pretty comfortable as the posh seats come covered with decent upholstery. At front, the dash that has dark shadow grey/silver and charcoal black amalgamation, witnesses smooth surfaces and is made up of standard quality material. The interior finish that includes audio bezel, air vent rings, steering wheel spoke shell, door trim applique and gear shifter comes painted in sunset silver, which gives a fresh every time cabin is visited. The driver's seat has height adjustment and lumbar support feature, followed by drivers arm rest, leather wrapped gear knob and leather draped cozy steering wheel. These commendable aspects make the driver feel convenient and confident on the drive and alongside provide an elevated stance to the driver. For the soothing view there is cool \xe2\x80\x98Ice Blue' back light illumination in analogue dials and other meters at dash. There are as many as 20 small/large stowage spaces inside the cabin for the occupants to keep their knick-knack. Furthermore the two 12V power outlets are provided each at front and rear row. Some more utilities include front seats map pockets, sunglass holder, passenger vanity mirror with light and under passenger seat storage . The rear seats have option of 60/40 split and 100% fold down. If one considers the usual 346L boot space less, than it can be increased up to big 705L.Interior Comfort:A wide range of features are packed in latest launch that promise passenger comfort to a large extent. The new additions in it include rain sensing front wipers and automatic headlamps. Also, electrochromic mirrors are introduced, which deflects the light beam from following vehicles so that, it can reduce obstruction to drivers. The SYNC with AppLink is retained, which is an advanced in-car connectivity system. This is useful to control phone, entertainment as well as apps using simple voice commands. This list further consists of an efficient air conditioner unit with heater, which allows to regulate temperature. The steering column is adjustable and telescopic for better drivability with minimal effort . The ORVMs are electrically adjustable and have turn indicators placed in them. Its four windows are power adjustable along with one touch up and down on driver's side. Moreover distance to empty, average fuel economy display and outside temperature display leads to more convenience.Interior Measurements:The interior of this vehicle holds unexpectedly huge amount of space that is capable to fit in as many as 5 medium sized individuals. There is adequate head room, leg room, shoulder room and knee room for all the occupants inside. Besides occupants space there is fantastic amount of boot space for the luggage and belongings. The boot space measures about 346 liters and can be extended up to a large 705 liters. The rear seat can be split 60:40, while the rear seat cushion comes with 100% fold down feature making way for more space.Ed's take: The acceleration produced by the Ecosport is good and we like the way the Ecoboost engine performs.As this vehicle looks sporty and raring to go from outside, it is made to practically prove the same when it comes to acceleration and pick-up. The different choice of motors coupled with fine transmissions in the form of 5-speed and 6-speed manual/automatic gearboxes lets you feel high with quick acceleration and gripping top speed. The turbocharged EcoBoost petrol mill with dual VVT is capable of reaching a top speed of 160 kmph, while it can get to the 0-100 kmph in just over 12 seconds. The 1.5L Ti-VCT petrol power-plant, which also powers the Fiesta, catches the 0 to 100 kmph mark in mere about 13.25 seconds along with the top speed of 168 kmph. Furthermore the 1.5L DV5 mill is been gifted with the potential to attain the 0 to 100 kmph mark in a mere 13.2 seconds, whereas it has all the abilities to enjoy a top speed of 175 kmph.Ed's take: The engine and performance of the Ecoboost and the other two engines is good. The Ecoboost definitely having an edge in performance.Besides the elite and exemplary design inside-out the manufacturer has left no stone unturned in providing the under hood with some rare technological advancements in the form of refined and reliable motor choices. The 1.0L, 999cc EcoBoost, 3-cylinder petrol powertrain generates a big 125 PS of maximum power at 6000 rpm together with a peak torque of 170 Nm at 1400-4500 rpm . This globally acclaimed motor is coupled with a 5-speed manual transmission. Likewise the 1.5L, 1499cc Ti-VCT petrol motor produces a decent 112 PS of raw power at 6300 rpm alongside peak torque of 140 Nm at 4400 rpm. This mill is offered with the option of 5-speed manual and 6-speed automatic transmission (AT) gearbox. Lastly, its 1.5L, 4-cylinder, 1498cc DV5 mill generates a max power of 91 PS at 3750 rpm and peak high torque of 204 Nm at 2000-2750 rpm. This motor too is mated to the 5-speed manual gearbox for smoother driving.Ed's take : The fuel efficiency of the Ecosport is good, especially that of the diesel. It returns about 14-15km/l, just like the Fiesta.The American automaker respects the prime concerns of its Indian car buyers and hence uses such technology that is economical in every aspect. Here too, with it comes with power-trains that are fuel efficient irrespective of the fuel option. The 1.5L Ti-VCT petrol mill with manual transmission is capable of providing a mileage ranging from 11.0 kmpl of 15.85 kmpl. Whereas the updated 1.5L DV5 oil, which also carries manual gearbox, delivers a decent mileage of 22.27 kmpl. Likewise the Eco-friendly and acclaimed 999cc Ecoboost petrol engine too churns out truly reasonable figures in the fuel efficiency column with 18.88 kmpl. Now this is definitely as per the promise from the manufacturer, which said 20% more fuel efficiency than conventional petrol mills.Ed's take: The most powerful engine on offer is the EcoBoost and it does feel like a 120bhp engine, and the figures are for real.The 1.0L EcoBoost 3-cylinder petrol powertrain produces a huge 123.37bhp of maximum power along with the peak torque of 170Nm. The other 4-cylinder petrol motor, the 1499cc Ti-VCT generates 110bhp of utmost power together with peak torque of 140 Nm at 4400 rpm. This mill comes with the choice of 5-speed manual and 6-speed automatic transmission gearbox. Moreover everyone's favorite diesel version is packed with a 4-cylinder 1498cc DV5 powertrain that pours out a maximum power of 98.59bhp and high torque of 205Nm.Ed's take: The Ecosport is loaded with several brownies and not just must haves like SYNC is something absolutely new to the Indian car market.Being one of a kind compact SUV the American automaker has bestowed it with some class leading entertainment systems in order to ensure leisurely long drives. This compact SUV comes with 2-line Multi-Functional Display (MFD) screen, while in the mid and top variants it is loaded with 3.5 inch MFD screen. For more entertainment there is stereo system with FM/AM Radio, Aux-in, USB interface alongside CD/MP3 player. To get the relaxing music heard there are in all 4 speakers, (2 front + 2 rear) and 2 tweeters at front . In addition to latest version Bluetooth there is modern \xe2\x80\x98SYNC' feature that takes the control of voice, as seen in the Fiesta sedan, making phone calls in-check. In addition 'SYNC', which comes in with partnership from Microsoft, comes handy during any emergency situation. The multi-functional steering wheel that has mounted audio and phone control switches further adds to effortlessness and practicality of this superlative SUV.Ed's take: Fords are known for their handling and the Ecosport is no different. The chassis is flexible and does drive well on bad roads and even on bends.The braking and handling has never been an issue till date. And as a result with this SUV too it continues the same reign, although one may feel that the brand has gone a notch higher in this aspect. Apart from getting tested on brilliant grip on the road the vehicle has also been scrutinized on the braking, suspension and handling part and has received better results. Here the front suspension has Independent McPherson strut with coil spring and anti-roll bar , while there is Semi-independent twist beam with twin gas and oil filled shock absorbers at the rear. Moreover the brakes at front have ventilated disc and rear has drum brakes. The braking and suspension is up to the mark and better than any stalwart SUVs running on the roads, but still the handing on corners at high speeds requires attention.Ed's take: The safety features on the Ecoboost is good and has six airbags, which no other SUV in this segment offers.The manufacturer has ensured maximum passenger safety in this new version by incorporating it with a wide array of features. It has offered remote central locking with flip key, while a locking wheel nut is also given for a spare wheel. The immobilizer system doesn't let the engine start unless it is inserted with the right key. The anti lock braking system and electronic brake force distribution, both improves its braking mechanism besides preventing it from skidding. There are dual front, side and curtain airbags offered, which altogether aids in avoiding any possible injury in the event of an accident. Also, it comes with emergency brake hazard warning, rear parking sensors, defogger, high mount stop lamp, configurable speed alarm in its fuel computer, seat belts for all passengers, emergency brake assist, as well as ISOFIX child seat fixing points that add to the security quotient. The top end trim in specific, additionally gets a few more advanced aspects like electronic stability control, hill launch assist and traction control systems that guarantees a risk free driving experience.This compact SUV is available with both steel and alloy wheels depending on the variants. The base and mid range options are fitted with a set of 15 inch steel rims. These are further covered with tubeless tyres of size 195/65 R15 that assure a firm grip and excellent performance on any surface.

sS'Tata Bolt'
p193
S"The Bolt may just be Tata Motors' way to tell the world that they're taking their age old design formula to an all new level. The company blends conventional elements with progressive ones, and infuses some modern scale delights in their recently launched hatchback model, the Bolt. The brand has a reputation of bringing low cost and featured products to the market, and this model consolidates on the substantial territory they had gained in the market through other releases such as the Zest and Indica.Pros:1. Rear bench legroom is amongst the best in the segment.2. Ticks all the safety boxes: Airbags, Anti-lock Braking System, Electronic Brake-force Distribution and Corner Stability Control.3. Loaded with features: projector headlamps, touchscreen infotainment system, automatic climate control etc.Cons:1.No automatic variants. Both Figo and Grand i10 have automatic versions in their line-up.2. Storage space inside the cabin is severely restricted. Just a cup-holder and an under-seat tray.Stand out Features:1. The ConnectNext Touchscreen Infotainment system, voice command and other advanced aids are a rare find inside this cabin.2. The 1.2-litre Revotron Turbo engine has formidable capacity, especially for a model of this segment.Overview:Tata is among the well known brands in the Indian passenger car segment, but most of their vehicles lose out in terms of inner sophistication. However, as we stepped within the bolt, we were delighted to see a wide slew of comfort and entertainment features add to the inner ambience. The bolt perfectly encapsulates the Indian middle-class dream, bringing a right mix of style, fervour, function and delight to the table, while at the same time, ensuring that the price tag doesn\xe2\x80\x99t break your bank account.Background and Evolution:The Bolt is in its first generation, and it is commonly considered to be a replacement of the Vista, which it shares a very noticeable design platform with.Exteriors:At first glance, any lay-dweller may feel unenthusiastic about this vehicle, but it took us few moments of close examination to grasp the wholesomeness of the vehicle's design. The front portion handsomely curves over in a widely shaped oval format, stretching out into the bonnet and then the hood, before collecting at the tail in a larger and more masculine format.We think that the slender nature of the grille at the front integrates into the front element very well, while the emblem of the company makes for a more distinctive statement. The humanity line that glazes the top of the grille captures the company\xe2\x80\x99s signature design. The smoked out multi-reflector headlamps accentuate the front, and the sharp shape of the lamps bring a more hawkish effect to it.If you're going for the top end trim, you get some additional splendour, for the top end gets fog lamps with a striking chrome bezel effect.In our opinion, the manufacturer makes a strong statement by making use of the dual tone nature of the front bumper, for it positions the hood and the bonnet in a more vibrant stature. The wide hood and the serene lines glazed atop it further add to its powerful design character, working to enrich the soothing vision of the front even more. The wide air intake section fits in with the layout of the front well.The metallic skin of the bonnet flows  into the side and drapes around the strong wheel arches. One of the greatest factor which adds to the look of the car is undoubtedly the alloy wheels, which brings a more aesthetic flavour to the build.Body coloured door handles and mirrors exert a more harmonious look when it comes to the side profile, while the sweeping lines that run through the door give the car a more pronounced persona. The most energetic factor, in our opinion, would be the swept back shape of the front window, which gives a graceful position to the car's side. This simple factor adds to the sophisticated image of the car's visuals, and it is sure to go well with the younger audiences that the brand aims for. Another element to be highlighted here would be the varying colour of the door frames, which have a black conditioning.The rear side of the vehicle is wider in proportion, and this gives the car a balanced look. One is sure to be taken by surprise upon viewing the LED illumination on the license plate, and this is a feature that competitors such as the Jazz have not been incorporated with. The flame shaped tail-lamps add vitality to the car's simple design, and the integrated rear spoiler takes the entire visual aspect to a more racy flavour for us.Dimensions are proportionate with a length of 3850mm, a width of 1695mm and a height of 1530mm.The car's boot space of 210-litres lags behind when compared to some of its rivals, although it would suffice for you if you can keep your travel needs nominal. We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend the vehicle for expansive travel needs, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for others in this segment with a reasonable boot area, there\xe2\x80\x99s always the Figo with 257-liters, or the Hyundai Grand i10 with 256-liters.Interiors: We found the taste of the interior design to be neither too grand nor too bland. It found the right balance in terms of its price range, and the presence of many sound comfort aspects is sure to boost the experience.First off, the body hugging seats make for a high level of comfort, and anyone expecting comfort during a ride would feel so as well. Headrests have been integrated to the front as well as the rear, and this improves safety as well as convenience when driving.But the factor that truly amazed us was the Java black interior layout, which resembles the theme of a sports car. The full fabric seat covering adds to the delight, and although it is not nearly as plush, it is definitely easier to maintain than beige and other more expensive upholstery.The centre console is positioned for convenience, so that the cup holder and the power outlet within it are integrated right into the inner environment. The buttons on the console have been arranged ergonomically, with large knobs for the AC that jut out.The Infotainment system screen has been propped right above this, fitting snugly with the clean centre console. The company has given the audience the added convenience of a smartphone enabled navigation system, a video playback facility, as well as an image viewing options. Needless to mention, music can be played via USB, AUX, Bluetooth and Radio.\n\n Little dabs of chrome - on the air vents and the parking brake lever tip, adds a touch of affluence to the entire atmosphere. Fabric inserts grace the door sides, and adds another layer of energy to the place in our opinion. The instrument cluster has two dials which house the tachometer and the speedometer respectively. It also gets readout for engine temperature and a fuel guage as well. The cluster gets a white backlight and is easy to read. The MID reads out basic information such as Current Gear, Trip A/B, Odometer and Economy. Instantaneous Economy is displayed by a horizontal bar at the bottom of the MID.\n\n The steering wheel by the right hand side is a picture of sportiness, with vibrant metallic highlights and the emblem of the company perched right at the centre. The wheel is just the right size and feels nice to hold.  There are buttons for audio and calls mounted on the steering wheel, and you\xe2\x80\x99re sure to feel more relieved with the operation as a result of this.Despite the lavish aura of the interiors, we\xe2\x80\x99d have to tell you that the storage space here is minimal, with only one cup holder and an under seat tray. It is also noteworthy that although the door sides come with pockets, they are too shallow to hold anything substantial.Performance:Diesel:The Quadrajet 1.3-litre diesel engine has been modelled to suit the BSIV emission norms, and this means lesser fuel worries for the owner. It consists of 4 cylinders and displaces 1248cc. The company has wired the engine with a common rail direct injection, while a manual 5-speed transmission channels the power efficiently to the wheels. It starts with a quick, dry rumble and then works out just as soothingly as one might expect. This drivetrain gives a power of 74bhp at 4000rpm, together with a torque of 190Nm at 1750rpm to 3000rpm.\n\n The engine is the exact same 1.3 litre unit that the Swift deploys. However, we have to say that Maruti has the better gearing. Ratios on the Maruti are spaced out much better compared to the Tata. The unit on the Bolt has considerable lag upto 1800rpm. However, once the turbo spools up - power is delivered in a nice surge.Petrol:Coming to the petrol trim, Tata is offering a Revotron 1.2 litre engine, which comes along with a turbocharger. Here too, the BSIV standards are met, and cleaner emissions could be a plus point for many of the company's customers. Apart from this, in terms of performance this plant slackens very faintly, with a displacement of 1193, a power of 89bhp at 5000rpm and a torque of 140Nm at 1500rpm to 4000rpm. The company utilises the same 5-speed manual gearbox here as well, and it makes for efficient shifting without too much strain for the driver.  A low hum engages the occupants throughout the drive, but the experience is otherwise unhampered.The turbo-charged 1.2 litre unit also gets Multi Drive Mode. The user can select between City (default), Eco and Sports. Naturally, throttle response is dull and lethargic in Eco - it is best used for long distance cruising. Sport mode is for when you are in a hurry - the throttle response is much sharper. City mode is a nice median.Ride and Handling:A combination of discs and drums form the braking system, and the stopping power was more than adequate in our opinion. We noticed a very slight imbalance in times of reckless braking, an unavoidable consequence of the model's weight. Tata has been making vehicles for Indian roads for quite a long time, and it is evident from the ride quality that their suspension systems have evolved over the ages to tackle the punishing environment of our roads. Rigged onto the front is a dual-path McPherson strut, and its functioning is further assisted with a coil spring and an anti roll bar. Meanwhile, the rear arm is compounded with a twist beam, with a coil spring and shock absorber further asserting control. The chassis layout contained most of the drive strains, with road bumps, potholes and rocks effectively absorbed into the ride. That isn't to say that there weren't hassles, of course. One must bear in mind that mild anomalies do send rustles through the cabin, but the average Indian driver would be more than prepared for these.Safety:When stepping into the cabin, an average person would hold this company's safety programs in a weak light. This car significantly makes progress towards the brand's emphasis on safety front. The downside however, is that the benefit of these features are exclusively preserved only for the higher end models. The starting edition comes with a very weak safety accord, with a mere rear door child lock and an immobiliser. Meanwhile, the high end versions come with speed dependant auto door locks, front seat belts that have pretensioners and load limiters, driver and co passenger airbags.Variants:It comes with four variants, among which XE is the entry trim. This, we would say, is for more cost-conscious people willing to forgo more high-end features.Meanwhile, the top end XT comes with an advanced array of features that includes the Infotainment system, Navigation system, Voice command, and also crucial safety elements like airbags, perimeter alarm system, a rear defogger and fog lamps. Along with this is automatic temperature control, one shot power down facility for the driver\xe2\x80\x99s window, and even a boot lamp, all of which are present exclusively for it. The punishing aspect of it would, however, be its price.XM and XMS could strike a balance between the two trims, and if you\xe2\x80\x99re willing to embrace some features and let go of others for a fair price, either of these trims could do well for you. A central locking system, power windows, Bluetooth facility, speed dependant audio control, electrically operated outside mirrors, along with the ABS, EBD and CSC systems aren\xe2\x80\x99t present in the base variant, but are integrated here.\n\n Verdict:At the end of the day, like most other cars, this one has its bag of plus and minus points. One needs to be selective about what he expects from the likes of the Bolt. If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a solid Infotainment system, decent interiors, and passable exteriors - this car would definitely delight you. All in all, the Bolt makes its mark in the minds of thrifty middle class Indian, but fails to impress those looking for a more opulent driving experience."

sS'Audi A8'
p203
S"Introduction:Audi is a name that's sure to stand the test of time. Here is a company that has got the entire auto realm crackling, with models that have won acclaim far and wide. Despite the strong base that the Four-Ringed company has worldwide, it is still hoping to push up its position here in the Indian market. The A8 is just the type of vehicle you can bank on to pull a feat like this. Just recently, an armour adorned variant was released, targeted at high profile personnel who were looking for security aside from mere luxury, performance and class.Pros:1. Alluring exteriors with some pretty rich make-up. 2. Slew of strong safety features that will surely get you satisfied. Cons:1. Its price range put off a massive share of Indian buyers. 2. The lack of cabin space might be seen as a deterrent for customers.Stand-out Features:1. The advanced range of entertainment and comfort features are sure to have your approval. 2. Its expensively lavished cabin arrangement would be a one-of-a-kind experience for most Indian buyers. Overall:The A8 has been one of Audi's major standing vehicles for a long time. The car has it all \xe2\x80\x93 the powerful exterior glamour, the intense performance, the affluent interiors and the reliable safety elements. The machine comes with four engine trims, of which two are diesel and two are petrol. All of them make for sound speed capacities, with displacements that range between 3000cc to a thrashing 6000cc. The in-cabin technology would boost any average person's ride experience, with a 7-inch display Navigation system, a parking system, a strong audio facility, exhaustively adjustable seats and many more facilities that most people would never have seen in an ordinary, domestic branded car. Exteriors:Audi is the brains behind some of the world's finest designing, and we'll be honest folks, we found real ingenuity in this car's design. It inherits the class Audi body language sculpture, with the long wheelbase, the prominent shoulder lines and the agile posture. A look at the vehicle tells you that its meant for some old school sprinting, with the aesthetic design and the streamlined shape. A low profile and the back-slapped wind-shield promotes the right airflow when driving, and this also facilitates better handling. We thought that the shaping of the front added a more aggressive vision to the look. The headlamps have a slick shape, stretching over towards the side for a more prominent mark at the front. The Matrix LED light systems add some intricacy to the interior designing of the headlamps, and we thought this made for a more sophisticated look overall. You've seen the classic R8 grille that drapes all the way to the bottom of the front skirt, and the same feature is present for this vehicle as well. The four rings of the Audi mark rest at the top of the grille, gleaming in full glory. At the bottom of the skirt, a thin strip exists for the air dam, and we thought it integrated perfectly into the image of the front. The metallic skin wraps over the wheel archs in an artistic manner, spewing some real fervour over the side. We know for one that most people would find the serene lines that glaze the door-sides gorgeous, and this creative spark is also mirrored in the soothing curvatures that shape the fenders, the door creases and the window line. The well designed wheels come in a range of variants for the occupants to choose from, including 5-spoke, 7-spoke, cast aluminium, forged aluminium and more, so if you're the more picky type, this is sure to enthral you. The roofline slides down gently, before melting into the rear portion in an athletic fashion. We thought that the more toned tail section perfected the vehicle's stance, rendering it balanced and harmonious. When you take a look at the tail-section, there's no doubt the racy impression carries all the way to the rear as well; The tail-lamps spread over the corner of the truck into the tail-gate section, profiled into a neat shape that adds to the visual delight. The twin exhaust pipes come with a slim, rectangular design, another element of proof that this model is as genuine as it gets. Interiors:The cabin exudes warmth, spaciousness and comfort. The only thing it lacks is the crisp sporty spark that race-styled cockpits have. Nevertheless, we're sure that it would put a smile to most ordinary passengers' faces. Some might hold fears that the inner design would be over-done, and so did we; But as we stepped into the cockpit, we felt a mixture of relief and exaltation. Aside from being convenient, the cabin strikes an artistic harmony that few vehicles we thought ever had. At the front, the long dashboard spills over towards the glovebox area at the bottom. A strip of walnut, dark brown wood on the dash adds to the power of the design. There are multiple AC vents which have been equally distanced from each other on the board. A thin piano black garnish at the bottom of the dashboard adds to the marvellous design touch, and we thought that it helped to diversify the entire look. By the centre of the board, the 7-inch colour display acts as an interface for many facilities of the car, including the multimedia system, the reversing camera, the parking system and many others. Aside from adding entertainment to the experience, it imbues the cabin with a more advanced aura, and what more do youngsters today want?By the corner of the board, the multi-function 3-spoke steering wheel is dressed in leather. The wooden segments on the wheel could go unnoticed, but they add a tiny bit of opulence to the place. There are gear-shift paddles integrated into the side of the wheel, and if you're a driver who enjoys an easier way of life, then this is sure to fascinate you. The instrument cluster has been positioned within eye's view of the driver, and it hosts a tachometer and speedometer.The door-sides have been graced with the same fine leather package that engages the entire cabin. Meanwhile, door sill trims come with an aluminium inlay, and this does enhance the vibrant atmosphere. Few people could find things to complain about with the seating arrangement. We certainly didn't; Even the taller and broader members of our team had an enjoyable treatment with the large leg-room and the comfortable seating facility. The ergonomically strong seats are further improved with headrests, electric backrest adjustment, lumbar support, thigh support adjustment and many more aids that are sure to keep you lifted in seventh heaven. The refined leather upholstery enriches the ride quality, and we personally thought that it was the best factor in the entire ride. Performance:Diesel:On the diesel side, there are two engine trims. The first is a TDI V6 mill that comes displaces 2976cc. It comes along with a turbocharger for improved performance capacity, while a common rail injection system ensures smooth transfer of fuel. The six cylinders of the engine come with four valves each, and an 8-speed trip-tronic transmission has been joined with the engine. You're sure to feel delight at the specifications \xe2\x80\x93 a power of 247bhp at 4000rpm to 4250rpm, and a torque of 580Nm at 1750rpm to 2500rpm. For the thrill seekers looking for a more robust performance capacity, a more powerful diesel engine is also present. The TDI V8 power-train consists of eight cylinders with four valves per cylinder, and it displaces a more husky 4143cc. Like its compatriot, it comes along with a a turbocharger, a common rail direct injection and an 8-speed triptronic transmission for the most efficient overall usage. This train generates a power of 380bhp at 3750rpm, along with a pounding torque of 850Nm at 2000rpm to 2750rpm. Petrol:At the petrol front, there is a V8 TFSI bi-turbo engine that comes incorporated with direct fuel injection, an Audi valvelift system, and an 8-speed triptronic transmission. It boasts some pretty brazen specifications, with a displacement of 3993cc, a power of 430bhp at 5100rpm to 6000rpm, along with a torque of 600Nm at 1500rpm to 5000rpm. Sailing past all over drive-trains, the last available engine is a W12 petrol engine that displaces a massive 6299cc. It also has the same intricacies of design as the other mills, with a direct fuel injection and a 8-speed triptronic transmission that make life easier for the driver. The mill's specifications put it well ahead of the rest, with a power of 493bhp at 6200rpm, and a thundering torque of 625Nm at 4750rpm. Ride and Handling:Strong discs have been fastened onto the wheels, and we thought that the halting, cornering and braking process was incredibly smooth. There is minimal body roll, but the high-speed inertia does get into the cabin some time, throwing the passengers off balance. This is the type of company that you expect the best from, and we thought that it did deliver with respect to the suspension arrangement. The advanced air-based suspension helps to ease the flow of the ride, thereby decimating flicker inconveniences. The ride stability is splendid, and you're relieved of most road hassles that you'd feel in most other vehicles. The vehicle absorbs jerks and bumps with a fluidic ease, but knowing Indian roads, you need to be aware that the car's suspension is ill-adapted for more battered conditions. Safety:The company has insulated the high speed menace of the engine with an advanced range of safety features, including Audi exclusive seatbelts, an anti theft alarm, a parking system plus, a park assist that comes along with a display. Also present is a reversing camera, LED lights at the front as well as the rear, a remote control key, a power assisted closing facility for the doors. If you've been in cars that boast high end techno controls, wait until you step into this one: dynamic steering, a controlled sport differential, an electromechanical power steering and electronic stability control together help build a strong ride quality, minimising chances of mishap. Variants:There are four variants, and the major difference among them is the engine trim. First, the A8 L 60 TFSI Quattro harnesses a V8 petrol engine, while the L 50 TDI Quattro comes with a V 6diesel engine. Next, the L 60 TDI Quattro comes with a V8 diesel engine, while the L W12 6.3 FSI Quattro has a W12 petrol mill. Aside from this, all of the trims come with the same comfort, entertainment and cosmetic features, and we think that this bodes well for people who have trouble selecting the right variant.  Verdict:Let's be honest here, we've got a car that we just can't point too many flaws with. It gives you mind-blowing performance, incomparable handling, a sensual exterior cover, and lavishly coated interiors. Driving it is a thrill and a delight, and we're sure few people would have nuances with the experience. But we've got to keep you informed of its extremely tall price tag, along with a lack of an expansive after sales service network. In the end of the day, this is the ideal for for people looking for a masculine, glaring machine with performance and luxury. But for those looking for just a nominal, down to earth drive experience, and those looking to avoid a pinch in the wallet, we'd recommend some other model for you. "

The space on the inside isn\xe2\x80\x99t as good as the competition and the feel of the plastics isn\xe2\x80\x99t that great. But the quality of the plastics is decent and things don\xe2\x80\x99t fall apart.The interiors of this cabin is a result of a great effort by the manufacturers and is furbished with efficient equipment. The seats are very well cushioned and gives great support. This compartment can take in four to five people. There is an instrument cluster embedded with various notifications.

These have a key-off reminder that is audible and a headlamp-on warning buzzer too. Excluding the LX, all others have a tailgate opener.

And those with CNG takes close to 7-8 seconds to reach this mark from scratch. A high speed of nearly 135 to 140 Kmph can be reached by it.Editor's take : The K10 engine on the Alto is frugal and also has good performance. The K10 is a stonker of a performer and sprint runnerA 1.0-litre, K-series petrol drive train is equipped to it with a capacity to displace 998cc. It is equipped with three cylinders and twelve valves that are based on the double overhead camshaft valve configuration. This motor with MPFI returns a mileage of around 24.07 Kmpl on highways and 20 Kmpl in the cities.

Under this mode, it can generate 58.2bhp at 6000rpm and 78Nm at 3500rpm. An efficient five speed manual transmission is offered for all except the VXi. It is paired with an auto gear shift.Editor's take : Despite being a 1.0-litre engine, the K10 returns a good fuel efficiency figure. This is thanks to the K-Series engine series from Maruti Suzuki.It is equipped with a K10B motor and it is based on a multi point fuel injection system. This enables to return approximately 22 Kmpl under city conditions and on the highways this increases to nearly 24.07 Kmpl. Under CNG mode, it delivers a mileage of 32.26 Km/Kg and this is very resourceful and affordable.Editor's take : The Alto previously was powered by a 800cc engine, the new 1.0-litre engine has boosted its performance.A petrol mill is incorporated in this carrying three cylinders and twelve valves that are based on double overhead camshaft valve configuration. It has a capacity to produce a maximum power of 67.1bhp at 6000rpm and can produce a peak torque output of 90Nm at 3500rpm. Whereas, when shifted to the other mode, it generates 58.2bhp in combination with 78Nm torque.It has an advanced audio unit that supports multiple players comprising a CD and an MP3 player. It also has USB port and a radio tuner with antenna fitted to the roof for its support. Two speakers are offered for the sake of sound distribution. The buyer can customize it with a few accessories based on the requirement. More features like fancy decals can be used to make the external appearance much attractive. Also, components like floor mats, leather upholstery, fabric inserts to inside doors and music system can be selected. Roof rails and roof spoilers can be included to improvise the style of the vehicle. Airbags and parking sensors can be integrated for improving the safety quotient.Editor's take : The ride on the Alto is soft, yet most of the jolts filter into the cabin, due to the small tyre size. The handling of the Alto is good enough and even zipping through busy streets isn\xe2\x80\x99t difficult.This series is equipped with an efficient braking and suspension mechanism too. The front wheels have a set of ventilated discs and its rear wheels are fixed with the drum brakes. The suspension comprises of gas filled McPherson strut to its front axle and a three link rigid axle type is used for the other one. The steering is highly responsive and has a minimum turning radius of 4.6 meters.Editor's take : The Alto misses out on features like dual airbags, and at the moment only Alto 800 and Eon have these features as optional.It has been equipped with a lot of significant components to ensure proper protection of its occupants as well as of the vehicle. The VXi (O) comes with a driver airbag that is a plus point. Besides this, it is built using lightweight steel including side impact protection beams and crumple zones. The LX has headlight leveling device, and three point seat belts for all with a 2-point fixed seat belt for rear center passenger. Then there is a high mounted third stop lamp as well affixed above the windscreen. It also has driver's seat belt warning lamp, a pair of fog lamps, a set of ventilated disc brakes and child locks increases the level of protection.All these are adorned with a set of steel wheels that are of size 13 inches. These are covered with full wheel covers in the high range trims. These rims are covered with a set of radial tubeless tyres of size 155/65 R13.1. Affordable price range that suits the masses.\n\n2. Exterior cosmetics and internal aspects are refined.\n\n3. Addition of the automatic gear box will certainly boost its sales.\n\n4. Spare parts and maintenance cost is quite reasonable.\n\n5. The mileage is at par with other contenders in this segment. 1. Absence of alloy wheels even in its top end version.\n\n2. Lesser ground clearance can be a hindrance sometimes.\n\n3. More security and convenient aspects can be added.\n\n4. None of them have advanced braking mechanisms like ABS.\n\n5. Very little luggage space. "

sS'Tata Sumo'
p215
S"The automotive industry in India carries a wave of variations, with companies representing a unique niche for their design ability and engineering. The range of companies that have shaped the car making in Indian soil has evolved greatly over the course of history. And among the many brands, Tata has stood out as one of the greatest. Here is a company that has towered above the rest, re-shaping the field of car making in the country. It was originally founded in 1945, and over the course of two thirds of a century, this company has endured as one a name steeped in glory. The line-up of cars and other vehicles that this car maker designed have assimilated Indian roads, and even seeped into the culture that now runs our roads. The brand is known for providing quality products that are, nevertheless, accessible and within the reach of common man. The range of vehicles that the company peaks with the Tata Sumo, an SUV designed for a range of on and off road uses. This is a model that has been in production for more than two decades now, originally released in 1994 to a market that was heading for stagnation. The release of the Sumo re-vitalized the Indian car market, and brought new vigor to a production industry that had slowed down and was heading for a dry-run at that period. Over the years, it found its well settled place in numerous fields of use, ranging from taxis to government vehicles to police wagons. Until today, this SUV reclaims its old fashioned build in a greatly modernized industry, and yet survives as one of the most imperative manufactures in our nation.The vehicle is tall and heftily built, evoking the design discipline of other SUV brands such as Hummer. The inside of the machine carries a powerful, 3.0-litre CR4 engine that has a displacement capacity of 2965cc. The powerful build of the engine also generates other stunning figures, including a peak power of 83hp, and a maximum torque of 250Nm. It can reach a top speed of 146 kmph which is, again, decent considering the design elements and the purpose of the SUV. All of this is sealed with the capacity to hold a larger load and to keep up the stability of its drive always on the roads. Therefore, despite the meeker figures of performance, this is a vehicle that holds true to other features of driving. It guarantees a solid experience with other facets of build as well, including a well trimmed interior design that falls short of little that one could ask for.A rich black linen interior is present for the cabin of the SUV, meant to appeal to a more refined classiness. The seats are large and well laid, comfortable and meant for the best accommodation. The seating arrangement is good, and grounded in firm ergonomic principle. A stylized instrument cluster with a chrome ring appeals to a great decoration for the passengers. The interior of the machine is fulfilled on all aspects, including techno ones. The driver is always kept on guard with a Tachometer on the instrument cluster. Further raising the convenience aspect is a low fuel indicator, also bringing better safety to the fore of the passengers' needs. The steering mechanism is based on rack and pinion steering system that provides best comfort and safety for the ride. Power windows aid the fluctuating preferences of the passengers when seated within the cabin, and the glasses of the windows are tinted for a cooler and more enhanced feel within the cabin. It is also complete on all fundamental necessities, such as a windshield wiper, also aided with a rear windshield wiper as well. A rear defogger also upgrades the convenience needs of the passengers. Further essential elements of convenience is taken care of, with a spare wheel below the floor. A 12V outlet on the center console is also a vital convenience necessities fulfilled. An anti glare rear view mirror provides security as well as comfort. Cup holders are present on the glove box lid, and a mobile holder gives added function. The floor console is complete with a handbrake.Moving to a more intimidating prospect, the exterior design of this machine is far beyond fulfilled on its needs. It has lines that are rigid and less sensual, unlike sports cars of the day. It is a vehicle that boldly adheres to the old fashioned grounding in its looks, evolving over the years but never wavering from the core of its make. It makes for its own niche of appeal to true vehicle lovers in that one make. The front bumper is wide and sinking lower towards the ground. The frontage is complete with a grille that is propped on either side by large and rectangular headlamps, and the company's emblem perched right at the centre. Wide air ducts sit below the grille, meant for providing circulation to the large engine. The roofline rises higher than most vehicles, and ducks towards the rear for a more conventional look. The rear of the machine carries lamps of the same format, complete with all fundamental needs that lamps of SUVs had. A large spare tyre sits wrapped at the centre of the rear, giving the machine its more distinguished field of appearance with respect to the sealing of its rear look. All put together, this is a machine that slams as a true achievement, never swaying from the soul of its purpose, and yet staying as a great model that is revered by the Indian market across two decades, and is sure to continue on this road of glory for some time now."

sS'Toyota Fortuner'
p219
S"Introduction:The Fortuner was originally launched at a price point of around 18 lakhs. Over the years, Toyota has increased its prices and as of today, the Fortuner is a 25 lakh rupee SUV. With every price hike, the feature list hasn\xe2\x80\x99t grown much. The numbers are fast dwindling from a phase where it used to outsell all its competition, combined. The refreshed Fortuner is stated for launch only in the later part of 2016. Does it still have the steam to ward off the better equipped and competitively priced Ford Endeavour? We find out. Pros:1. Tough and rugged build with a go anywhere attitude. 2. Imposing design, even after so many years. High on road presence. 3. Decent fuel efficiency compared to the competition. Cons:1. The ladder on frame design compromises on handling. The Santa-Fe offer better sorted handing with its monocoque body. 2. The interiors are dated and the feature list is short. Stand-Out Features:1. The cabin area is expansive, and family-goers will surely love taking a ride with this.2. It has pretty respectable performance when placed beside others of its class.Overview:The Fortuner is offered with two engine options. The original 3.0L and the 2.5L derived from the Innova. The 3.0L version is offered in 4 trims. A 4x2 and a 4x4,  in combination with either an automatic or manual box. The interiors have a 3 row layout, a favourite with buyers in this segment. We've got to admit, the vehicle does lack in some aspects, and this includes the entertainment and comfort elements among others. The infotainment system is dated and no match to what the competition current offers. With people demanding a lot from a car in the segment and its price point, Toyota has got to pick up its game. Exteriors:Standing tall and wide, the vehicle makes quite a bold impression at first sight. The design reeks an aura of menace. The front end is aggressive, with the massive hood with the scoop, the striking chrome grille and imposing bumper. The same aggressive design continues all the way to the back. This gives it oodles of road presence and is sure to make people move out of your way. Starting with the face, the dual tone radiator grille makes for a majestic poise at the front. Flanking this on either side, there are smoked headlamps with chrome highlights and we loved the subtle plushness here. The air dam along with the fog lamp housing run a black theme with the fog lamps a neat chrome bezel. The hood scoop posted at the centre of the bonnet adds some sporty value to the visuals, while the gentle lines on the bonnet balance it out. Along the side, the chrome door handles grabbed our attention. The black window frames and roof rails diversify the look, while the massive wheel fenders add muscle to the side. At the rear, the tail-lamps come with a concise design, while the chrome strip wraps up the dynamic effect that the machine constantly tries to make. Interiors:When you step inside the vehicle you will be greeted with a spacious cabin. The cabin is immense in size, and it can comfortably house seven adults. Tall, plump and burly members of our team found little to fret over during the course of the drive. The dash is a single tone black unit with touches of brushed silver and wood insert. Air conditioning vents simple trapezoidal units that close individually. The design of the centre console is down to earth and nothing out of the world, which is fine in our opinion. The infotainment system in a touch screen unit and is flanked by knobs and buttons. By the right of the dashboard, the 4-spoke steering wheel was great to hold, and we thought there was no compromise on grip. The wheel is dressed in leather, and accentuated by silver accents. The infotainment, MID and voice control system are present on either side of the steering wheel. Positioned right in front, the instrument cluster houses the speedometer, the tachometer and a third dial displaying fuel indicator. The speedometer comes with chrome rings, and the illumination on the dials makes it easy to read at all times. When you take a seat in here, it's more than clear to you that the Japanese company has applied a sound knowledge of ergonomics in terms of seating arrangement.The seats are wide and comfortable, and we could find very little to complain about. The plush leather upholstery adds a more enriched quality to the drive, while the integrated headrests and armrests further rake up comfort. Members of our team seated in the second row were more than happy with the legroom there, but the third row could have done better. While the back support is excellent, the seats lack under thigh support. Performance:Packed within the car is a D-4D diesel engine that displaces a respectable 2982cc. The machine impresses with some pretty neat specs, including a torque of 343 Nm at 1400rpm to 3400 rpm, and a power of 142 bhp at 3400 rpm. We were happy with the overall power-play of this engine, with a low turbo lag and a linear power delivery that will ensure a good ride experience for most. Overtaking is easy, and can even be done without down-shifting. However, we've got to tell you that the loud engine noise might dampen your spirits, while at higher, sailing speeds, you should be able to let it pass. Ride and Handling:Most of Toyota's models come with pretty robust dynamics, capable of taking on the tough Indian roads. This one was no different, but there definitely could have been improvement. The chassis is well suited for the needs of our roads. Uneven terrains occasionally bring out the bumpy side in the ride, and we would credit the body-on-chassis construction for this. The vehicle's body roll is quite contained, and we were surprised at the stability it can sustain at speeds higher than 130kmph. Its grip is also a pleasant factor, and we couldn't help but get the feel that it was cemented onto the floor all the way while driving. Its stopping power could be improved but is typical of SUVs of this size. Safety:The vehicle keeps its front occupants well shielded, with airbags as well as seat belts that come along with pretensioners and belt force limiters. Meanwhile, some advanced safety programs help to address the average passenger's concerns, including the anti lock braking system, the electronic brakeforce distribution system and the vehicle stability control. Aside from safety for just the occupants, an immobiliser brings safety for the machine as well, preventing theft and other insecurities.  Variants:The vehicle comes in four variants, 4X4 AT,  4X4 MT, 4X2 AT, 4X2 AT. The cosmetics, comforts and convenience features are standard across all the variants, and the sole difference is with respect to the drive format and the transmission. Verdict:If you would have asked us a year back, the Fortuner was one of the best options in the premium SUV segment. At this point, with the Ford Endeavour as its competitor, the Fortuner seems over priced and ill equipped. While it retains the advantages in terms of a rugged - go anywhere machine, we feel you should wait till the new one arrives. "

sS'Mercedes-Benz GL-Class'
p223
S"Mercedes-Benz GLA-Class is yet another sophisticated product from the German automobile firm that reinvented the perception of an urban SUV. It is a pure SUV with design elements of a sedan that makes it a unique contender in its league. Initially, the firm introduced this SUV series in just one trim and in later stages, its AMG version was put on offer for the Indian customers. The automobile firm classifies this luxury vehicle as a compact SUV, but its overall length measures more than 4.4-meters earning its rightful position among mid size luxury vehicles. It is currently available in three variants with one petrol and diesel engine option for the buyers to choose from. Its petrol motor is a 2.0-litre turbocharged power plant and the oil-burner is a 2.2-litre motor that is paired to a 7-speed 7G-DCT automatic transmission gearbox. This vehicle looks stunning from the insides and it resembles the silhouette of the A-Class hatchback. On the other hand, buyers have a choice to personalize the interiors with either all-beige or all-black color scheme. As for its exterior styling, this vehicle has compact structure adorned with several trademark features like bi-xenon headlamps, along with LED DRLs and a sturdy set of 18-inch alloy wheels. However, the main attraction of its appearance is its chrome plated grille that is embodied with the iconic company's insignia. This SUV is fitted with an array of comfort features including electrically adjustable front seats with memory function for driver's seat. Also, there is an auto air conditioning unit and an advanced parking assistance. To add to the customer excitement, the manufacturer is offering panoramic sliding sunroof as a standard feature for all the variants. The manufacturer is offering this vehicle with innovative active safety features such as impact protection beams, tyre pressure monitoring system along with ATTENTION ASSIST and three point seat belts. It also happens to be the first vehicle in its class to feature seven airbags as standard. Also available for the customers to choose are the optional packages, which includes various equipments and facilities.

Currently positioned in the entry level luxury SUV segment, it is rivaling against the likes of Audi Q3 and BMW X1 in India. It is currently available on offer with an unbeatable warranty of 3-years without any restrictions to its kilometers.This SUV from Mercedes Benz has a typical body structure unlike an SUV, and it stands with a total height of just 1494mm. This adorns it a look that no other SUV has it in their respective segment. Its front facade does like classy, but the sporty cosmetics renders it an intimidating look. The radiator grille up front has horizontally positioned louvres and are embedded with the company's logo. The headlight cluster has a black tinted design and is housed with xenon headlamps along with signature LED DRLs and turn indicators. Below this, it has a dual tone bumper featuring a pair of large air ducts and an air dam, which offers better ventilation to the engine. When viewed from the side facade, this vehicle looks much alike a crossover owing to its low and masculine stance. The primary reason for its sophistication is because of the so called 'dropping-line' that extends from its headlamps to the rear fenders. The flared up wheel fenders are accompanied with a set of alloy wheels that further adds to its dynamic stance. There are several other stying features given to this vehicle including aluminum ski racks, body colored door handles and glossy window frames. As for the rear, this SUV has a perfect look with larger taillight cluster and rugged bumper. As we can see, its bumper has a dual tone scheme owing to the black colored protective cladding. The windscreen is also accompanied by a spoiler featuring an integrated LED third brake light along with a wiper as well. The overall look of this vehicle is emphasized by the prominent company's star, which is embedded on to the tailgate.Exterior Measurements:The manufacturer has built this four wheeler with an overall length measuring 4417mm along with a decent height of just 1494mm. Its minimum ground clearance is 183mm, which is somewhat equivalent to a conventional sedan. This vehicle has a decent width of 1804mm (excluding ORVMs) and a wheelbase of 2699mm, which is quite long.Ed's take: The GL-Class always had spacious interiors, however the styling was basic. Mercedes-Benz has taken care of this aspect in the new one and now the design is contemporary and we will like interiors of this SUV. From the outside, it looks like a compact vehicle, but step inside, the cabin design will tell you a different tale with its huge space. With this SUV, customers will get an option to customized its interiors with three different color schemes. Furthermore, they can be highlighted by either metallic or wooden veneers. Its interiors are done up with extensive use of ARTICO leather upholstery and highlighted with chrome accents. Its dashboard has star-shaped AC vents garnished with silver accents. The dashboard in the cockpit looks quite sleeker than other company models and is equipped with an array of features. Some of those include a music system, an AC unit along with an instrument cluster and a multi-information display. Also, there is an attractive 3-spoke steering wheel with leather cover and is mounted with multi-functional switches. But the most important factor of the cabin is that it is furnished with comfortable seats, which redefines the ergonomics. The rear cabin seat has a split folding facility in 60:40 ratio, which is helpful for extending the boot volume. Its internal cabin is fitted with an array of utility features including storage boxes, drink holders, sun visors, accessory power sockets and digital clock.Interior Comfort:This model series is packed with a range of sophisticated features that eventually offers an unmatched driving experience. Currently, it is available in two trim levels like Style and Sport. Among these, 'Style' is the base trim, which has all the standard features including an automatic air conditioning system, rear adjustable AC vents, dust along with pollen filter. This trim also comprises of information based features like a speedometer, fuel gauge, tachometer, outside temperature, digital clock, and gearshift position notifier. Beside these, it also has ECO start/stop function, 4-way lumber support for front seats, large glove box unit, adjustable power steering column, memory function for driver's seat, power windows with one touch operation, electrically adjustable outside mirrors, multi-functional steering wheel and remote operation for boot opening center armrest for front and rear. On the other hand, its high end 'Sport' variant has features like panoramic sliding sunroof with automatic rain sensing function, adjustable armrest, trip computer in multi-functional display and illuminated glove compartment. The manufacturer has also blessed this variant with a sophisticated PARKTRONIC parking assist function featuring rear sensors and camera, which offers acoustic and visual parking aid on infotainment screen.Interior Measurements:As for the dimensions of insides, its front cabin has a total headroom of 1015mm along with a decent leg room of 532mm.

This vehicle also has a total 421 litres of boot volume, whose capacity can be extended further with the help of 60:40 split folding second row seat.Ed's take : The acceleration of the GL-Class is good, and the seven gears help to spread the torque more evenly. The GL 63 AMG does a naught to 100km/hr in under 5 seconds. Being mated with 7-speed DSG automatic transmission gearbox, both the power plants scores high with regards to acceleration and pickup. They can achieve a top speed in the range of 205 Kmph. As far as pickup is concerned, its oil-burners can break the 100 Kmph speed mark from a standstill in 9.9 seconds, while the petrol trims can do it in just 7.6 seconds.Ed's take: The GL-Class now has better power to weight ratio, despite the same engine and the drivability has always been good. The only thing that we dislike is the responsiveness of the transmission. The petrol version is powered by a 2.0-litre, in-line drive-train that is integrated with variable valve control technology and direct fuel injection system. This power plant comprises of 4-cylinders and 16-valves altogether making a displacement capacity of 1991cc. This DOHC based mill is also integrated with a turbocharger that helps it to deliver a maximum power of 181bhp at 5500rpm in combination with 300Nm of pounding torque between just 1200 to 4000rpm. While its diesel variants draw power from a 2.2-litre oil-burner that has the latest generation common rail fuel injection system. This motor is also based on DOHC valve configuration featuring 4-cylinders along with 16-valves, which displaces 2143cc. This motor is integrated with high pressure Piezo injectors that enables it to produce a maximum power of 134bhp in the range of 3600 to 4400rpm and yields a superior torque output of 300Nm between 1600 to 3000rpm. The car maker has paired both these motors with an efficient 7-speed DSG automatic transmission gearbox that releases the torque output to its front wheels.Ed's take : Buyers of GL-Class do not worry about efficiency, still the GL-Class is generous with its fuel consumption. Especially, the GL 63 AMG owners which is the most powerful SUV in India at the moment. Its oil-burner is integrated with a critically acclaimed CRDI fuel injection system featuring Piezo injectors. These are high pressure injectors, which enables the power plant to unleash immense power and at the same time, they also helps to deliver a maximum mileage of 17.7 Kmpl. While its petrol engine is incorporated with a conventional direct fuel injection system. This empowers the SUV to give away a maximum mileage in the range of 12 to 14 Kmpl.Ed's take : The power produced by the GL-Class is good on paper and we have liked this 3.0-litre V6 diesel mill. The GL 63 AMG is the most powerful SUV in India with about 550bhp of power available on tap. Its 4-cylindered diesel drive-train is based on DOHC configuration and displaces 2143cc. This turbocharged motor has the ability to churn out a maximum power of 134.1bhp in combination with 300Nm of hammering torque. Its petrol motor is also based on a 4-cylinder configuration and is integrated with variable valve control technology for optimum power generation. It can belt out 181.03bhp of maximum power along with 300Nm of hammering torque.Ed's take: Mercedes-Benz has ensured that the GL-Class comes loaded with several accessories and a huge list is also available as an option. Its entry level trim gets a cutting-edge central media system featuring 14.7cm touchscreen. It also comprises of a CD player, radio tuner along with connectivity ports for AUX-In and USB devices. Also, there is Bluetooth connectivity for seamless audio streaming and for in-cabin telephonic operation. Its high end trim on the other hand is also blessed with a 450W surround system system designed by Harman Kardon. It delivers superior quality sound output with the help of 9 loudspeakers and 9-channel DSP amplifier.Ed's take : The GL-Class drives just like a car. This is the biggest advantage that it possesses. The handling of the AMG is definitely much better than the conventional E-Class. This SUV is bestowed with 'comfort' suspension system comprising multilink system for its rear axle and an independent strut suspension for the front one. In terms of braking, its front wheels are fitted with a sturdy set of ventilated disc brakes, whereas its rear ones are coupled to solid disc brakes. Aiding this mechanism is the anti lock braking system that works in combination with brake assist function to reduce the possibility of skidding. In addition to these, this SUV gets a latest generation electronic stability program that works in collaboration with curve dynamic and hill hold assist.Ed's take: The safety features list is long on the GL-Class as it gets airbags, ABS, ESP, hill-assist, PRE-SAFE etc. This SUV is built with high strength aluminum material, which is quite rigid and capable of dealing with collisions. It comprises of side impact protection beams and crumple zones at critical areas for added safety. As for the features front. both the trims in this series are equipped with identical safety functions. Some of those include seven airbags, three point ELR seat belts, head restraints, driver's seat belt warning, door open indicator, rear parking sensors, seat occupancy recognition system for front passenger, collapsible steering wheel and anti-glare inside rear view mirrors. Besides these, they also have an advanced engine immobilizer system with rolling code, remote central locking system including unlocking of doors, anti-theft alarm, and protective under-body guard. The manufacturer has also incorporated it with sophisticated programs like electronic stability control, dynamic curve assist, hill hold assist, anti lock braking system, anti slip regulation, and brake assist function.Both the trims level in this model series have been bestowed with a set of 18-inch, 5-twin spoke design alloy wheels. The only difference is that the 'Style' trim gets these rims with high-sheen black finish, whereas in top end variant, they have vandanium silver finish. These rims are wrapped with 235/50 R18 sized tubeless radial tyres for better grip on any road condition.1. Its internal cabin has better space than expected. 2. Compact size helps it to glide through traffic easily. 3. Comfort aspects are far better than other competitors. 4. Engine performance along with acceleration is quite good. 5. This is the first vehicle in its segment to have seven airbags.1. More options can be given to customize its interior design and color scheme. 2. Fuel economy of petrol motor is rather poor. 3. Price range can be more competitive. 4. Head room is not as good as other SUVs. 5. There is still scope to improve its minimum ground clearance."

sS'Maruti Gypsy'
p227
S"Some countries have vehicles, which define the entire automobile segment in that country. Though the automobile market in a country has a large appetite to fit both domestic as well as international manufactures, some companies remain to enjoy an unending customer loyalty to their products. One such company is Maruti India, which is one of the largest automobile manufacturer in India. Regardless the model, in any segment the first choice of a customer remains to be a car from this comapany. Be it the exceptionally efficient service centers spread throughout the country or the unending range of services offered by the manufacturer in the country, they have always struck the right chords with Indian customers. The best thing however remains its legacy, which helped the manufacturing giant in not just gaining ever increasing customers, but also an impressive experience, which comes handy when a new vehicle needs to be launched in the market. Being the manufacturer of the first people\xe2\x80\x99s car, the 800, the company never ceased to grow ever since. It forayed into the SUV market with the Gypsy in 1985, when off road vehicle and SUV as a term were in a budding phase. A legend among off road enthusiasts, this continued to be extensively used by people not just in the regular localities, but also for hardcore purposes such as military and other off road capabilities, where the vehicle needs to pass through some of the toughest terrains in the nation. It is no secret that this company has been a preferred option for not just customers but the government officials too. Though the vehicle was initially offered in a soft top convertible design, it soon progressed to offer a hardtop , so that the off road capabilities stay intact irrespective of the environmental constraints. With its amazing build which maintains a robust appeal, the 1298cc engine offers a superior control over the vehicle and it even allows the user to witness more power. Since the vehicle runs on petrol, the performance and pick up are extremely impressive hardly leaving any room for design loop holes. With an interesting 210mm ground clearance, the machine provides challenging off road capabilities even in terrains as raw as hills. The diaphragm spring clutch is designed with enough strength to withstand high rotational speeds. The entire build from the tyres to the framework are designed to withstand extreme temperatures. The load on the engine is also considerably less in this vehicle, which already has a strong thermal conductive nature where it heats up in extremely snowy conditions. Though high temperatures might not be a considerable issue, the low temperatures certainly end up being a tough call. The maximum output generated is an apt 80bhp at 6000rpm. The various weather conditions this vehicle can handle makes it one of the most successful SUV in the nation which actually stuck to its traditional design.The exteriors are specifically designed to match the off road capabilities of the vehicle. The fact that this car maker created a vehicle, which was used even by the military personnel is an indication at the design and engineering excellence attained by the company. The overall design is offered both with a soft top model as well as a hard top model. The soft top variant though offers a simple convertible design, the vehicle falls vulnerable in the odd temperature zones where the vehicle inevitably falls prey to the environmental issues. The hardtop variant however offers a bolted top, so that the passengers are more relaxed. The entire structure of the vehicle is an innovative effort in creating a sustainable off road vehicle. The front fascia defines authority of the vehicle which is really helpful in creating a powerful image in terms of the viewer. It has a prominent front grille, which was a typical Maruti design that has lasted throughout the early years of its manufacturing. The headlamp cluster and the front grille fit in a long rectangle with the typical round headlamps in the edges almost along the breadth. The basic structure also depicts a straight design for the front fascia instead of curvy structure. The front bumper has a subtle statement with reflector lamps on the bumper, which adorn in the slightly framed bumper design. The front bumper also offers a stylish appeal to the vehicle and more or less helps the vehicle in avoiding most of the obstacles. The side profile of the vehicle is also a pleasure to watch as it demands power and a simple design statement. It never seems flamboyant and no excessive muscle is placed anywhere. The beautiful thing about that however is that the machine does exactly what it is supposed to do, it performs. One of the most important thing that needs to be considered however is the price of the vehicle. The car maker did a really amazing job in maintaining a cost effective design despite not compromising with the performance. The side profile offers two reflectors at each end and the wheel arches of the vehicle are slightly prominent protruding out as an additional element rather than a part of the framework. The entire design, in fact, seems a bunch of bits and pieces perfectly coupled together making the vehicle a real pleasure to modify or develop whenever required. The side profile also offers a simple black lining in the under part of the body to avoid any bushes or rocks effecting the doors or chassis. The rally versions however offer halogen lamps so that extreme off roading can be achieved. The drivers side has a rear view mirror and the spare wheel is equipped with a wheel cover. The front foot step assembly is provided for the Hard top, while the soft top version comes with a foldable front windscreen so that the vehicle remains extremely windy while riding.\n\nExterior Measurement:\n\nThe overall length measures around 4010mm. The measurements of the vehicle are apt and are created in a way that it would be an easy transition to the Indian automobile customers who are relatively new to the SUV segment, at least when it was launched. The width of the vehicle is kept at a decent 1540mm, which again reassures the perfect build and appeal. The overall height of the vehicle is a decent 1845mm. The wheelbase of the vehicle is big enough to fit most of the rocks and bushes, so that the SUV can maneuver through the roughest of paths. The machine has an enormous 2375mm wheelbase. The front track of the vehicle is 1300mm, while the rear track is 1310mm.It features slightly traditional design as it is mostly devoid of any modern contemporary designing features. The SUV though, offers a great build with innovative interior system with respect to the time, when it was designed . The interiors offers quality spacing for eight passengers with two passengers sitting in the front while the remaining six sitting in opposite rows in the rear section of the SUV. The most impressive part of the vehicle however remains the spacing offered for the passengers in front row. The leg room in the front row is ample and since the seats can be adjusted further, the vehicle features a class defining space. The driver as well as co-driver seats are adjustable hence they can be altered according to the user specification. The air conditioner vents are placed both in the corner near the driver as well as of the co-driver.

S"Mahindra Supro van is the latest product in the utility vehicle segment, wherein Maruti Omni is still continuing its dominance. By its appearance, this vehicle looks much more like a people mover or like a maxi cab. However, the manufacturer ensured that it isn't just about an affordable mobility solution, but also about style and comfort. Starting off with the exteriors, we can see Mahindra's signature radiator grille up-front with chrome garnishing. Also, it has the company's logo embedded beautifully onto it. On its side profile, we can see body decals that somewhat add style to this van. But one cant deny the fact that the vehicle looks like the one made from scratch. Its interior design looks far better than its outer structure and can provide accommodation for eight adults. Its cabin has a dual color scheme giving a soothing effect to the eyes. This latest model from M&M has been launched in a total of three trims, all of which are powered by a 909cc diesel engine. This oil-burner is currently powering some small commercial vehicles of this company. Being a 2-cylindered mill, it produces a power output of 45bhp, which is good enough to move this 8-seater. By the way, its mid range VX trim is available with 5 and 8 seater option, while the top end ZX trim is purely a five seater. There are not many features associated with this van, since it is in the entry level segment meant to cut down the mobility cost. However, there are few essentials like a heating, ventilation and air conditioning unit that reduces the amount of stress by a greater extent. Also, there are facilities like mobile charger (12V), a digital clock, magazine pockets and a multi utility box. For the convenience of driver, this vehicle also gets an electric power assisted steering that simplifies the handling.\n\nMoving on to the safety section, it has a special front nose design ensuring maximized safety of occupants. This vehicle also gets the Mahindra's tough and rugged body structure with impact protection beams at crucial areas. Its dual LSPV braking mechanism is another factor that helps to improve control over the van, especially in case of sudden braking. Available with a warranty of 60,000 kilometers for 2-years, this vehicle comes as an ideal option for families.This is where company has applied reduced efforts in making this van. As we can see, its exterior structure represents outdated design. But the factors like body decals and chrome accents compensates for lack of proper design. On the front facade, we can see the signature radiator grille with vertical slats. Accompanied with this is a horizontal chrome strip, which is embedded with the company's logo. On its surround, there are headlight cluster housing halogen lamps, courtesy lights and turn blinkers. Its large front bumper is the one that adds bold appeal to this profile. It has a perforated air intake section along with provisions for fog lamp housings. Its front profile is the only thing, which is stylish about this van. The design of its sides is something that we can call it as a fashion disaster. It only has a basic design of an automobile. Its window frames and pillars looks cluttered, which isn't adding any style. The only style factor of this facet is the body decals. Its fenders are accompanied by standard steel rims, but they are accompanied with full wheel covers. The second row gets sliding doors that makes it convenient for gaining access to the insides. Its rear facet looks somewhat attractive considering its sides, all thanks to its stylish taillight cluster. The tailgate also has a decent structure and is decorated with models lettering along with brand's insignia. To enhance more safety to this facet, its windscreen is accompanied with a third brake light.\n\nExterior Measurements:\n\nIf we go through the external dimensions of this van, we will certainly feel surprised and gets the doubt, whether if it is really an eight seater. This van measures just about 3798mm in its overall length and 1540mm in total width. Its wheelbase figures should leave you in a shock, since it is just 1950mm. The only good thing about its exteriors is its height of 1922mm, which is nearly equal to its overall wheelbase.The no-nonsense part about this four wheeler is its internal cabin. Once we go through the design, we will get an idea about the amount of importance it received from the maker. They have ensured basic essentials inside like storage units, charging point and other utilities to fulfill the requirements of passengers. One should talk about the seating arrangement, which is its plus point. Its cabin looks quite spacious from inside and it can accommodate a maximum of eight passengers. Its cockpit has seating for two while the rear cabin houses six adults. The rear cabin has two bench seats facing each other, creating more leg space for the occupants. This facility is available only for base and mid range trims. While the top end trim has seating option only for five adults. This vehicle gets sliding doors, which allows passengers to gain access to the cabin effortlessly. The interior is in a dual tone color scheme, which is another interesting factor of this vehicle. Going into further details, it has a distinctive instrument cluster featuring several gauges and meters to keep the driver informed. Its dashboard houses a glove box along with equipment like an AC unit. The steering wheel looks pretty simple with just two spokes and its grace is further amplified by the brand's insignia. Its floors are in brown color scheme, giving a plush appeal to the insides.\n\nInterior Comfort:\n\nLike mentioned above, this van from M&M is currently available in three variants. Among those, LX is the base version that has limited number of features. It lacks basic essentials like an AC unit, power steering and utility boxes that only adds to the traveling woes. However, it houses few facilities like a digital clock, cabin lamps at front and rear, a 12V mobile charging point and grab handles. Some of the other features in the list includes magazine map pockets and sun visors for both front passengers. The next-in-line VX 5-seater trim also has same set of features, but additionally, it gets a multi utility box as standard. Moving on to the top end trim, it is equipped with a heating, ventilation and an air conditioning unit that helps to reduce maximum discomfort that is caused while traveling. But disappointingly, the AC vents are present only in the front cabin. Apart from this, it additionally comes with a color coded interior along with bottle holders in central console. The mid range VX and top-of-the line ZX trims have electric power assisted steering system, which is helpful to reduce stress and efforts required to handle this van.\n\nInterior Measurements:\n\nThe official brochure from the maker has no details with regards to the interior measurements, but we can see that it has good space. Like mentioned above, it can offer accommodation to a maximum of eight passengers along with space for luggage storage as well. It is also accompanied with a fuel tank that has a storage capacity of 33 litres.It would be biased to expect this van to be good at acceleration and pickup. Its power figures, weight and capacity does explain that this is a vehicle intended solely for transportation purpose. As a matter of fact, this van doesn't even reach a top speed of 100 Kmph, since its ability is limited to just about 95 Kmph. Hence, the pickup figures wont make much of a difference in this case.Powering this latest model is the 0.9-litre diesel engine, which is also performing duties in other CV models of the company. It is being tuned to draw more power from the thrusters, eventually compensating for its weight. It is a two cylindered mill integrated with a direct fuel injection technology for maximized output. This oil-burner with full thrust can generate a maximum power of 45bhp at 3750rpm and releases a torque of 98Nm between 1600 to 3000rpm. Its transmission duties are handled by a conventional 5-speed manual gearbox.Looking at the size of its engine, one would expect better mileage from this Van. However, its power to weight ratio and outdated direct fuel injection technology are the factors that are tarnishing its fuel efficiency figures. As for the company's claim, this vehicle comes with an efficiency to deliver a maximum mileage of 23.5 kmpl.The 909cc diesel mill is made to pull heavy weights. We can see the same oil-burner under the hood of Maxximo commercial truck and other CV's designed by the company. However, this 2-cylinder based mill has been tuned to churn out better power. As we can see the details, it produces 45bhp that results in a torque output of 98Nm.This vehicle scores nil with regards to the entertainment factor, since there is no CD player, nor at least FM/AM radio tuner. Customers have to depend on the vast accessory market, where they can find a number of such gadgets at a reasonable price. They can equip it with a 2-DIN music player along with speakers. Also they can opt for a touchscreen infotainment system that adds more excitement to the passengers inside. Besides equipment, one can also opt for styling factors like leather seats, floor carpets, alloy wheels, and other features that can give a new look to this van.This is one section, where it scores big as compared to others. This van, unlike other contenders, has got vacuum assisted hydraulic braking system with auto adjuster that provides maximum control over the van. Adding to this, its front wheels are mated with discs and the rear ones are assembled with drums for superior braking mechanism. As for suspension, its front axle is loaded with McPherson struts that further have coil springs. While the rear axle is being fitted with leaf spring type of suspension for maximized comfort while traveling. Its steering is another factor that reduces the efforts of handling this van.This four wheeler is built with the company's robust design, which is tough and rugged. This eventually gives it the capability to tackle the collision impact and to provide safety to the occupants inside. Its unique front nose design is another factor that enhances the safety levels. This vehicle is associated with a few other safety features like child safety locks, seatbelts, halogen lamps, rear reflectors and a high mount third brake light.This entry level van is being fitted with a set of standard 13 inch steel rims mated with full wheel covers. These wheels are further wrapped with 155/80 R13 sized radial tubeless tyres for better grip on roads.1. Presence of wide service network is its biggest advantage.\n\n2. Fuel smart technology helps to reduce fuel consumption.\n\n3. Its price range is quite reasonable.\n\n4. Cabin space and seating option adds to its advantage.\n\n5. Attractive warranty is its plus point.1. Absence of music system is a drawback.\n\n2. There is a need to improve its exterior structure.\n\n3. Comfort features are too little.\n\n4. Its wheelbase is shorter than a hatchback.\n\n5. Its safety section lacks basic features."

sS'Fiat Avventura Urban Cross'

S"Introduction: Fiat India, the subsidiary of the Italian automobile firm is operating its business in the country for almost two decades. However, it never really managed to be successful in the country thanks to its obsolete model line-up and tough competition from the likes of Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai. Since two years, this firm is trying hard to break into the Indian market by launching new models and by updating its fleet. Now, at the 2016 Auto Expo, it pulled-off covers over the so called Fiat Avventura Urban Cross that managed to grab the attention of on-lookers. Based on the existing Fiat Avventura crossover, this newly unveiled model is said to be coming with two engine options. It is unclear when the product will be launched in the country, buy reports suggest that the vehicle will be ready for a launch in third quarter. Pros:1. The external appearance of the concept Avventura Urban Cross looks stunning. It is a typical Italian car with great build quality. 2. Its interiors are spacious and seating seems comfortable.Cons:1. Interior design lacks the sheer quality of a premium car.\nStandout features:1. It features a high resolution touchscreen infotainment system with Bluetooth, USB and other standard equipments.2. With 1.4-litre T-jet petrol engine under the hood, it can outperform all other performance cars in its class.Overview:It is perhaps for the first time in India, Fiat has managed to steal the attention with its newly unveiled model. Although, the car is based on the Avventura, it looks evidently different from the existing one. It is most likely that the car maker will launch the product with two engine options. It is too early to speculate about the variant line-up or regarding the features that the car could come with. However, by looking at the company's moves since last two years, we can expect for a few surprises with this Urban Cross. It is most likely that the car would be launched in the festive season. Soon after its arrival, it would go against the likes of Volkswagen Cross Polo, Ford EcoSport and others in its class. Exteriors:The exteriors of the Avventura Urban Cross is something that will surprise you. It is perhaps the best looking car designed by Fiat so far. Although, the design and its construction is based on the lines of Avventura crossover, it looks drastically different from the former. It has a build quality of a premium car that would certainly impress the auto lovers. The front facade of the car has the semblance of other Fiat brand cars with intuitive design, perfect fit and finish. It looks bold and powerful thanks to the sporty bumper, headlight cluster and a distinctive new grille. The headlight cluster has the similar design that can been seen in Punto Evo hatchback. What makes it look different is the distinctive lighting pattern. Its production version could house conventional lamps along with LED DRLs and turn blinkers. The radiator grille has a hexagonal shape with a new diamond cut design, which is the most attractive factor of the car. We can see extensive amount of metallic garnish to the grille that elevates its sporty nature. Unlike regular crossovers, this one comes with silver garnished sporty body kit that dresses-up the fenders and lower section of the car. These wheel arches have been paired with a set of alloy wheels that adds to its sporty characteristics. The rear section of the car looks much alike Avventura, but with better build quality and finish. The rear windscreen is wider and is accompanied with a spoiler along with a third brake light. The boot-lid is garnished with the company's emblem along with the model's designation. Like its headlight cluster, the rear light cluster too has a distinctive lighting pattern. Also, it can be seen with metallic inserts and LED turn indicators. We have to admit that the car looked stunning at the auto show. It has everything that is needed to grab the attention of a young buyer. Interior:This car shares its interior design with other Fiat cars, especially Punto EVO and Avventura cross. However, we can see extensive use of leatheratte material on the dashboard and seats that helped in bringing a rich appeal to the insides. The manufacturer seems to have focused on improving the quality of the insides with the use of glossy black and leather materials. However, poor plastic quality is something that spoiled all the hardwork. The dual tone gray and black colour scheme was a true stunner, in our opinion, and we felt a more youthly persona invoked by the set-up. The steering wheel comes with a classic three spoke design, and the flat-bottom effect adds to the brilliant look. We also noticed multi-functional switches incorporated into it, and this is sure to ease the driver's load in many lengths. The instrument cluster has been positioned within the field of sight of the driver, ensuring least disruption during the drive. Incorporated into the cluster is a tachometer, along with a speedometer, both of which come with well-designed, attractive dials that are sure to add a spark to the driver's experience. We thought the layout of the dashboard reflected a strong, sophisticated art, with a more modern structure for the centre console. The AC ducts are present over the console, and at the heart is the audio system display. The buttons for the system     have been smeared around the display, and this builds up a more harmonious look in our opinion. Moving away from the centre console, the car's door panels have been graced with an eye catching design, and the finish adds to the resplendent allure. You're sure to love the contrasting colour schemes that stretch over the doorsides, making for a more artistic impression within the car. There are thin orange lines that circle the AC vents, and surround the centre console, and we thought this added a more spiced-up and distinctive effect for the entire place. Meanwhile, the ergonomically built seats are sure to come with fine fabric, and you can also keep your fingers crossed that the company would do the honour of giving leather upholstery. Performance:As of now, we can't confirm anything about the vehicle, but as we followed online news sources, we found that the vehicle was likely to come with the same engine that powers the Fiat Abarth Avventura. The 1.4-litre T-Jet petrol engine is a decent performer, yielding a power of 138bhp at 5500rpm, along with a torque of 210Nm at 2000rpm to 4000rpm. We thought that specs spoke for themselves, but we've got to inform you that there are other vehicles in this segment that boast better characteristics. The engine's power is to be channelled through a 5-speed manual shifter, and we expect the shifting to be a rather smooth affair, giving this company's track record. As for the handling of the engine, we're unable to tell you about the engine's drive quality, for this vehicle has been kept well blanketed from the media and news outlets. Ride and Handling:Fiat has demonstrated a sound understanding of our country's road conditions, for as we drove other, closer models of the brand, we thought the overall quality was great. Bumps and jerks are sure to be expected, considering the untameable condition of Indian roads. We're happy to bet that this model will carry the same drive characteristics, except with very small nuances in the driving style. Strong discs would be worn at the front and rear wheels, and this is sure to ease out the stopping and cornering process. We hear rumours of other conventional drive programs such as the Anti-lock braking system, as well as the Electronic stability control, although we can't confirm these for sure. The chassis arrangement is usually left for no compromise, and you'd be safe to expect a McPherson strut at the front and a rigid Torsion beam at the rear, helping to cement a strong handling. We're willing to cast our hopes out that this vehicle's handling and overall drive quality goes further than most people would believe. With its well aligned dimensions, it's sure to be a pleasant experience to drive, with minimal discomforts and strains. Safety:Airbags, seatbelts with pre-tensioners, a warning for open doors and unbuckled seatbelts, strong LED headlamps and many other strong facilities that strengthen safety could be expected. You could also hope for advanced techno programs to cement the safety quotient, preserving the overall ride stability and keeping the occupants both comfortable and at ease.

sS'Hyundai Xcent'
p257
S'IntroductionHyundai Xcent has big shoes to fill in after being named the official successor of the Hyundai Accent. The Accent has been in production for around a decade - a successor was inevitable. More so, since the sales are off and the competition is getting ahead. But Hyundai made all the right moves and even got the next car named similarly to keep up the continuity in our minds. Clever indeed.Pros1. Good looking compact sedan, all-pleasing design.2. Best-in-class build quality and interiors.3. Neutral handling and comfortable ride quality.Cons1.Handling not for enthusiasts.2. Rear seats good for only two people; third will be a tight fit. Stand out features1. Best-in-class boot space (407 liters).2. Chilled glovebox, rear-ac vents - good to have features at the price point. ExteriorHyundai has done an excellent job of converting a hatchback, Grand i10 into a sedan, the Xcent. The boot has been seamlessly integrated into the body, which seems to be a challenge in the compact sedan segment. Especially in the case of converting a hatchback into a sedan for the obvious cost cutting reasons. The Xcent, just like the Grand i10, is longer than its European version.The front of the Hyundai Xcent is a colour copy of the Grand i10. You get the same face but the hexagonal grille now gets a chrome surround around the air dam. The swept back headlamps and the fog lamps are neatly designed.To the side, there\xe2\x80\x99s the same silhouette as the Grand i10 till the B-pillar. A sharp crease joins the door handles to the tail lamps while a black moulding through the waist adds as a safety aid keeping away the scratches through tighter parking spots. As we move closer to the C-pillar, the differences begin with a different rear door and then there\xe2\x80\x99s the boot. The roof rails that made their presence known in the Grand i10 take a leave of absence here. The three quarter profile of the Xcent displays the contemporary design of the sedan styling. At the back, the wrap-around tail lamps look neat while the rear bumper looks meaty. Some may take the rear styling of the Xcent to be too simple. The parking sensors are body coloured in the Xcent while the reflectors in the rear bumper are different from the Grand i10. The top end variants get dual tone diamond cut 15-inch alloy wheels while the lesser variants get 14-inch ones. The 15-inch alloy wheels look good adding a touch of style to the exteriors. Other features include chrome finished door handles, ORVM mounted turn-indicators, chrome number plate garnish, stubby radio antenna at the rear etc. InteriorsHop inside the Xcent and it\xe2\x80\x99s the same layout as the Grand i10 and it\xe2\x80\x99s good. These interiors are amongst  the best in the business. The quality of the materials and the way the parts are put together match the cars from a segment above. The interiors get a black and beige treatment, which seems to be norms these days. The interiors are airy with the full beige seats and the cabin feels spacious.  The steering is sized just right and feels premium to hold. The steering mounted controls are neatly laid, good on size and easy to access.  For the instrument cluster, a big speedometer in the middle takes the spotlight with a half-moon tacho to the left and two dials for engine temperature and fuel level to the right. There is also a multi-information display below showing the odometer, two trip meters and other useful information while distance to empty meter is sorely missed.The centre console gets an entertainment system on the top with two circular AC vents to either side. The 2-DIN integrated system supports radio, MP3, CD, USB, Aux-in and Bluetooth connectivity and also has a 1 GB internal memory for all your music needs.The bottom of the centre console gets the automatic climate control setup on the top variant. This is an upgrade over the Grand i10.Storage space comes in the form of bottle holders on all the doors, cup holders in the middle, fairly spacious glove box and other nips and knacks. The front seats are very comfortable with amazing under thigh support but the integrated headrests continue to probe our complaining cells again from the Grand i10.At the rear, two people can travel comfortably but fitting in a third person will make things a bit uncomfortable. This can be attributed  to the narrower width of the Xcent when compared to the competition. But the Xcent more than compensates that in the boot space, which is a segment-leading 407 liters. Absence of rear folding seats limits the cargo space to the boot alone.PerformanceHyundai Xcent is available in both petrol and diesel versions. A 1.2-litre engine powers the petrol Xcent while a 1.1-litre pot drives the diesel Xcent.  Both the units are carried over from the Grand i10. The petrol gets the option of a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic gearbox, the diesel version gets only the 5-speed manual. The fuel economy is rated at 19.10 kmpl for the petrol and 24.4 kmpl for the diesel as test by ARAI. The figures are not segment leading in either case but they will do.Xcent PetrolThe petrol Xcent makes a maximum power of 82 bhp at 6000 rpm and maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4000 rpm. The petrol engine is extremely smooth, high on refinement and offers flawless power delivery. Low end torque delivery is smooth, the mid range is very good and on the highway, the petrol engine easily quips the diesel one easily, especially when you have to overtake. The gearbox shifts into positions nice and easy.Xcent DieselThe 1.1-litre 2nd Gen U2 diesel engine made its debut with the Grand and makes a maximum power of 70 bhp at 4000 rpm and a peak torque of 160 Nm at 1500-2750 rpm. The 3-cylinder is weaker than the competition but the drivability is good enough for hassle free city commute. Linear power delivery ensures clean power output while the turbo lag is kept to the minimum. As told earlier, the diesel engine is no highway charmer, failing to put in any horses past 3700 rpm.Ride and HandlingAs is the Grand i10, the Xcent too has been tuned for ride comfort over handling. So, while you can go on driving over speed bumps and irregular roads with minimum disturbances, don\xe2\x80\x99t expect the Xcent to get enthusiastic around the corners or curves. Overall, the handling of the car will neither surprise you nor excite. The steering, typical of Hyundais is feather light. It is an absolute boon inside the city. However, it feels dead out on the highway. There is next to no feedback from the steering and the sense of vagueness will often turn into nervousness at triple digit speeds.SafetyHyundai Xcent comes with the ABS standard on all variants while driver and front passenger airbags are on offer for the top two variants. Other safety features include engine immobiliser, central locking, rear parking sensors, rear camera and rear defogger.VariantsHyundai Xcent comes in four variants for both petrol and diesel versions - Base, S, SX and SX (O). The Base variant gets you engine immobiliser, central locking, day and night rear view mirror, ABS, body coloured bumpers, full wheel cover, power steering, blue interior illumination, adjustable rear seat headrests, manual AC with heater, cooled glove box, front power outlet, front power windows and internally adjustable ORVMsThe S variant will be one of the best selling variants as it offers lots of features without going much above the cost. The features include rear defogger, rear parking sensors, body coloured ORVMs and door handles, turn indicators on ORVMs, waistline molding, 2-DIN music system, steering mounted audio and Bluetooth controls, rear power windows, electrically adjustable and foldable ORVMs, tilt steering, driver seat height adjust, keyless entry and rear AC vents.The SX takes safety further with driver and passenger airbags, electro chromic inside rear view mirror, rear camera and 14-inch alloy wheels.The top end SX (O) offers smart key, 15-inch alloy wheels, chrome outside door handles, leather wrapped steering wheel and gear knob, auto AC and push button start/stop.VerdictJust like its hatchback brother Grand i10, the Hyundai Xcent brings segment leading features, great build quality and contemporary design to its own segment. While the features and build quality will do wonders for the car, the exterior design may come off as too plain for some. The Xcent is amongst the best compact sedans you can place your money on.'

S"In India, there are automobile manufacturers and there is Maruti . Be it the thirst to have a native automobile manufacturer or the unbeatable service stations all across the country, the company always hit the right notes with Indian automobile audience. Every car it launches has the same amount of curiosity and when the product finally launches, the crowd find themselves applauding. The reason is a simple fact that this company never actually took Indian customers for granted. Inspite of constant customer base, they strived hard in bringing some of the very innovative automobile design parameters to the country. While maintaining the iconic models the company created over the years, it went on to produce more iconic vehicles whose ubiquitous appeal helps them attain a cult status relatively quicker than others. The 800, the Omni and the Alto, these are just some of the few vehicles, which registered their place with any individual who is aware of the automobile industry of the country. After launching such iconic vehicles, indisputably the most successful family commuter remains to be the Omni. With its iconic sliding doors and a capacity to handle 8 passengers with ease, it instantly became a sought after choice for large families which India is renowned for. But the changing times force even the most sought after vehicles to think a step ahead and offer an alternative so that the vehicle remains iconic and customer is provided a choice to opt for a much contemporary vehicle. Volkswagen faced it, Mini Cooper faced it and in Indian market, this acclaimed manufacturer faced it too. So it opted to leave the Omni intact without any change and launched an new vehicle, which would cater the needs of contemporary customers. The alternative was the Versa. But after a lot of efforts by the renowned car maker, they ultimately decided to launch this model, the Eeco which reflected its contemporary design architecture not just in its name but also in its truly Eco-friendly functioning and an advanced exterior framework, which bears no resemblance to the Omni and hence acts as a true distinct product. The latest version is offered in a five seater design also has an AC, while the seven seater version offers a great comfort for even larger families. A CNG kit is added in the car's CNG five seater AC version. The model also comes with a powerful 1196cc BS-IV compliant engine. The fuel competency of the vehicle is enhanced by the engine management system of the engine, which ultimately succeeds in being a perfect solution for Indian roads as it also offers an amazing 15.1 Kmpl mileage. The company also succeeded in offering the vehicle in a refreshing look, which does compete with both the routine transportation vehicles as well as SUVs and MUVs, while maintaining its highly affordable pricing. The 1196cc engine runs on petrol which makes the output power obviously competitive. With 73bhp at 6000rpm, this car also offers equally competitive torque of 101Nm at 3000rpm. Being an environmental friendly car at its core, it offers spacious interiors also to match its comforting exterior conscious. The whole structure is simple with a less nuisance about additional embellishments in the external framework. Evidently, the manufacturer means business with this model and its design reassures its stand on the same. The five speed manual transmission allows the vehicle to maneuver through different speeds with ease. The CNG variant, however is designed in a bi-fuel mode, so that the vehicle can run on both petrol as well as CNG. The interesting part is the fact that both fuels use the same 1200cc engine, so there would not be a significant difference in performance and comfort. The CNG mode however can only cater an output of 63bhp at 6000rpm and the torque produced by the mode is an equally decent 84Nm at 3000 rpm. The Intelligent Gas Port Injection bi fuel technology, dubbed as i-GPI, helps in increasing the fuel economy and offering safety, which would have been compromised when the same CNG kits are installed by customers individually from other sources. The factory fitted CNG kit also provides a genuine affair where any further issues can be resolved by a reliable source, the company itself. There is something distinct about this car be it the elegant exterior design or the uber cool interior design or even the really satisfying performance. Offering revolutionary products like Omni, this seems to be the perfect successor to the iconic vehicle. As a new update to the growing market demands, the manufacturer released the 'Smiles' variant, which offers a few advanced tweaks in the interiors as well as exteriors as a very affordable price. By giving in some additional money, customers can avail a new level of luxury with advanced 2-Din music system with USB, a pair of powerful 15 cm speakers, dual tone seat covers, a set of durable black floor mats for interiors and stylish full wheel covers, mud flaps and an exclusive 'Smiles' stickers on the body, which gives the truly exquisite feel of this limited edition. This model too is however available in both petrol and CNG options."

This is a brand that holds a greatly prominent share of the car market in our country, and has been a major player in this industry for more than three decades now. Most of the machines that the company drives to city roads are meant for utility more than style and glamor, and come with a nominal price tag meant to cater to the common man's needs.

Among the great vehicles that the company has set forth is the Omni, a mini van. This is a machine that was originally released by Suzuki under the name of 'Carry'. When originally set out in other countries, it was brought out with a variantly different format. The machine went through numerous revisions and upgrades, and was eventually released in India under the title 'Omni'. This is among the most modest and humbly built Vans in history, yet capable of serving its purpose and keeping the necessities fulfilled within it. The mini van comes with a greatly illustrious history that defies the expectations that were set forth upon it both by conventional thought and by the company.

The machine has been gifted with a great balance and precision system to go along with its performance. Being a minivan as it is, the Omni needs to strike the right stability to keep itself together with the lanky posture that it takes up. As a result, Maruti leaves nothing unturned in providing the perfect blend of braking and suspension for the benefit of those seated in this vehicle. The calipers arming the brakes at the front and rear are advanced and upto the mark, with discs at the front and drums at the rear. Additional stability is provided with the help of a good suspension system as well. The front axle has McPherson strut, while the rear axle gets a leap spring with shock absorbers for maximum ease when driving. All put together, the Omni is given the benefit of a truly extraordinary stability and balance for the length of its drive. Coming to the last and the most prime instrument of a vehicle's design, the Omni has top notch safety design within it. It is upto-date on all conventional features of safety, and it brings to the fore three point seatbelts and a good body format for optimum impact protection. A 2 speed windshield wiper keeps the screen clean during rain and other rough conditions. All of this put together, this is a machine that guarantees the very best to its passengers, fulfilling its purpose as a machine of function that delivers everything that one needs."

S"Introduction:Tata\xe2\x80\x99s Nano is a special car. It\xe2\x80\x99s a car that started its journey more than half-a-decade back as India\xe2\x80\x99s most affordable four-wheeled offering but has been suffering from an underwhelming response, to say the least. Ratan Tata\xe2\x80\x99s dream of delivering a One Lakh Rupee Car to the world, very soon, became a lesson in marketing don\xe2\x80\x99ts.If I put it briefly, the number of Nanos sold annually is equivalent to the number of Altos sold in a month. But despite this, Tata hasn't given up and continually improving the product and investing in it. Twist and then the current GenX model with an AMT, Tata has left no stone unturned but I guess, that first impression spoiled it all.Pros:1. Cute & Cool styling2. Priced more than a lac lower than the Alto AMT3. Light power steering & small footprint makes it a breeze to manoeuvre in urban condition4. Openable tail-gate & bigger fuel tank for enhanced practicality5. Powerful air-conditionerCons:1. Sluggish performance of AMT2. Sub-standard plastic quality3. Bumpy Ride Quality; Suspension tuning could have been better4. Too light to handle cross-winds \xe2\x80\x93 Fast heavy vehicles passing by can really disturb Nano\xe2\x80\x99s motionStand-Out feature:1. The cheapest Automatic car in India2. Fuel Efficient \xe2\x80\x93 Delivers close to 20kpl in combination (city and highway)Design:After seeing a Nano, the first word that comes out of your mouth is \xe2\x80\x98Cute.\xe2\x80\x99 Just 3164mm long and 1750mm wide.Nano has quite a proportional design and stands taller than most of our regular hatchbacks at 1652mm high.The 2015-launched GenX Nano gets a new face, an automatic gearbox and above all a fresh appeal. It retains the familiar shape though. We quite like the Grinning face of the Nano with the new smiley-shaped bumper. But the same smiling bumper looks out of place at the rear, though it's functional. The plain headlamps are now replaced with smoked units with Nano engraving in it and chrome garnishing around the turn indicator. There\xe2\x80\x99s a piano black strip between the headlamps, which seems looks like a radiator grille and adds appeal to the front fascia.Side profile, on the other hand, remains away from any alteration. That profile of the Nano has been the same for all these years. Tyre upsizing is one thing that Nano desperately needs because the 12 inchers are too bad for the visual appeal. The ground clearance is 180 mm.On the rear, as we mentioned before, gets the same smiling bumper and kind of misfit. There\xe2\x80\x99s an integrated rear spoiler in place, which looks way better than the earlier unit. This newest Nano\xe2\x80\x99s tail can be opened but the way to open it \xe2\x80\x93 is with a key as there\xe2\x80\x99s no remote boot opener given. The exhaust pipe, which used to be in centre, now peeps out from the left. Apart from the regular colours(except Orange) Nano GenX is available with two new colours, namely the Sangria Red & the Persian Rose. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a big fan of Red, so plain colours are still my cup of tea. Also, interior colour codes change with the different body colours & trim levels \xe2\x80\x93 Funky! \nInteriors:The dashboard of the Nano GenX is the one that we first saw in the Nano Twist. It gets different colour combinations for different trims and looks way better than the old model. The centre console is now finished in black and the flashy silver is out.The orange-lit instrument console is still there in the centre and houses a MID with clock, distance to empty counter, an instant fuel economy bar and two average fuel economy counters. Additionally, the unit gets a 'low fuel' warning. The steering wheel(sans the piano black inserts & audio controls) is good to hold and has been borrowed from the elder siblings Zest and Bolt(smaller of course.) Aircon is fantastic and works fantastically even in peak summers.Front seats have a dash of orange on them and offer decent comfort. Though their skinny structure causes discomfort with a tall rear occupant, as his/her knees can be felt at the back of front seats. Comfort on the rear seats is also good, but only for short drives due to a very strict posture and lack of support.One thing that has always impressed me \xe2\x80\x93 is the space in Nano. Due to its compact dimensions, buyers generally pre-assume that Nano is cramped on the inside. There\xe2\x80\x99s ample leg-,head-,shoulder-room for at least 4 occupants, if not 5. Also, the ingress and egress is effortless.Another factor that makes the new Nano more practical \xe2\x80\x93 is the option of an open-able boot. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a big boot and good for carrying two small to medium-sized bags at best, but \xe2\x80\x98something is better than nothing.\xe2\x80\x99 Also, folding the rear seat can give you a boot equivalent to a full-sized sedan.Engine & Performance:Tata has left the 624cc, two-cylinder, rear-mounted petrol engine unaltered. As per company claims, the unit has been tweaked for a minor bump in real-world fuel efficiency, rest it\xe2\x80\x99s all same and puts out the identical 37 Bhp @ 5,500 rpm and 51 Nm of torque @ 4,000 rpm. So, the only addition that you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice in this regard is the availability of a 5-speed AMT gearbox, alongside the regular 4-speed manual. This AMT gearbox, like most manufacturers, has been sourced from Magneti Marelli.Nano is a delight to drive in city driving conditions. For a sub-650cc engine, it feels pleasantly peppy under initial acceleration and continues to be so till 80kph. One of the biggest contributors for this performance is its light weight that tips at just 600 kilograms. Driveability is great and the tiny engine never feels underpowered (as compared to sub1000cc cars) in the start-stop condition. You\xe2\x80\x99ll hardly need any frequent downshifting when commuting around the city. Even in 2nd gear, you can crawl in slow moving traffic, save for the times the Nano comes to a complete halt.  It\xe2\x80\x99s really checkable \xe2\x80\x93 compact dimensions, small footprint, quick steering with a turning radius of just 4 meter turning make the Nano really enjoyable in traffic. Now the AMT. While the manual version doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow you to complain, performance of the auto version is a wee bit lacking. Automatics anyway sap more power than manual transmissions and the Nano already have very few horses to exhaust. Cruising at normal speeds is not much of a bother and the AMT works well during that. However, the problem arises when you try to overtake a vehicle and the Nano at times wheezes and feels a bit reluctant to overtake. Then there is a sport mode on offer, which tries to hold the revs for a little longer. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suit the character of li\xe2\x80\x99ll cute Nano. While the gearbox isn\xe2\x80\x99t best in class, the overall drive feels like an absolute boon in dense traffic. Yes, the sound from the two-pot unit is annoying at times, especially when you try to go too hard with the right foot.Ride & Handling:Nano gets gas dampers and independent suspension at its each end. This kind of independent suspension layout was integral to the space packaging of this tiny offering. If you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice, the wheels are placed at the four extreme corners of the car and seem pushed out as far as they could be. And this is the main contributor for Nano\xe2\x80\x99s respectable road manners.Suspension is tuned for city and at those speeds, the Nano is a great car to live with. We won\xe2\x80\x99t call the ride quality great but the overall experience is decent. It feels slightly bumpy over imperfect roads, especially for the rear occupants. So, for its core use as a city car, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find the ride quality to be at acceptable mark, if not above. Nano has decent road manners, in fact way better than a car that\xe2\x80\x99s feather light. As long as you are not trying to be too enthusiastic, the Nano will never really disappoint you with nice overall behaviour. However, crossing the 90kph mark on the speedo will make things a bit nervous, the cross winds starts affecting. Also, if a faster vehicle passes by, the Nano loses a bit of its composure.The SUV-like ground clearance & short wheelbase make the Nano \xe2\x80\x93 a perfect companion for the Indian roads. The steering direct and feels great to use on the move. Feedback from the unit is also decent. \nSafety:While safety has always been a point of concern for the Nano, Tata now claims that they have enhanced the torsional stiffness by using stronger materials and strengthened members. The C-Pillar of the latest is also beefed up for the opening tailgate. Increased length has helped the Nano to gain some more crumple zone and enhanced frontal protection. In addition, the doors get side impact beams, and there is an anti-roll bar as well. Having said all this, Nano still lacks Airbag and ABS in the range-topping trim.Variants:Tata is offering Nano in three trims, namely the XE, XM and XT. Even the base XE costs twice the Nano of 2008 and still misses on some very basic equipment such as power steering. While features like the music system, centre locking, power windows(front) and fog lamps are restricted to only the top XT model that costs more than INR 2.5 lacs.  So, the basic idea of making the Nano seems vanished when you see the prices of the current gen. model. And this is also the main reason behind its poor sales. The automatic gearbox is not available with the base model and the CNG is only available with the middle XM variant.Verdict:The Nano, in the newest Gen Next avatar, is a great offering for someone who wants a small and efficient city car. The in-built flaws of its original like the top-heavy shape, tiny wheels, limited cabin storage and small boot are still there with the Nano and digesting that at a price equivalent to country's most successful car- Maruti Suzuki Alto, seems like a difficult call. But Tata Motors have tried their level best to bring it up to speed with the segment standards and has added Bluetooth-equipped audio system, power steering, an openable hatch and, of course, the automatic gearbox, which makes Nano \xe2\x80\x93 even better at being an intra-city compact car."

sS'Skoda Rapid'
p281
S'OVERVIEW:Introduction:The Skoda entered the Indian market with the Octavia in early 2002. It enjoyed immediate success and helped establish the Czech brand quite quickly. We Indians quickly became fans of the TDi engine and the superb handling it offered. In an attempt to replicate this success in other segments with potentially higher volumes, Skoda launched the Rapid. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see if this car lives up to the hype that its elder siblings enjoy.Pros:1. Solid dashboard, great seats, lots of infotainment features. Great Interiors overall.2. Handling continues to be top-notch while the ride comfort is also very decent.Cons:1. Can prove pricier to maintain/service compared to other cars in the segment.2.The horrible after-sales stories continue to haunt the company. Skoda has been specifically focussing on this aspect since last year, but the verdict is still open.Stand Out Features:1. After the 2014 update, it now offers the legendary DSG gearbox on its diesel variants. The gearbox provides the best of both the manual and automatic transmissions.2. Optional Black Package for the top-end variants simply oozes style and class.Background and Evolution:The Rapid first entered the market in 2011 with the promise of Skoda\xe2\x80\x99s interior quality and handling levels at a much more pocket-friendly price. The only updates to it in late-2014 have been a new diesel engine and the addition of a new automatic gearbox to this diesel lineup. Interiors have also been spruced up a bit to match the competition, but the overall design has remained the same. A facelift due later this year. EXTERIOR:The Skoda Fabia is definitely a very handsome car. It has the trademark European \xe2\x80\x98no-frills\xe2\x80\x99 design which contrasts the flashy, chiseled looks of its Asian competitors.At the front, you have the trademark Skoda grille with the black vertical slats and a chrome plated strip resting on top carrying the company\xe2\x80\x99s redesigned badge. The Headlamp clusters on either side look a bit wide-eyed compared to the sleek ones seen on the City, Verna or VW\xe2\x80\x99s own Vento. Their roots in the Octavia are evident and this was perhaps Skoda\xe2\x80\x99s thought process too. Projector headlamps however, are on offer only for the top variant. The sculpted bonnet at the top and the simple fog lamps at the bottom add a touch of elegance to the front face.Coming to the side profile, we see a single, prominent line that runs across the vehicle between the wheel arches. Just enough effort to distinguish it from the Vento perhaps. That aside, the 15-inch wheels fill out the wheel arches sufficiently. The alloy wheels that the top variants get have a new design after the 2014 update and the new ones look much better.The rear is where it\xe2\x80\x99s shared platform with the Vento becomes evident. At a glance, the two look identical. The tail lamps however have the C-shaped design that is typical of Skoda. Also, there are two diagonal kinks flanking the nameplate on either side and one horizontal kink below it that are absent in the Vento. Overall it still maintains the simple, classy look that befits the Skoda badge.The Rapid is almost the same size as the Vento and just like the Vento, it has the least height and wheelbase in its segment. This might not bode well for the 5th occupant.In terms of boot space, the Skoda turns out to be the lowest while the Vento is actually on the higher end of the spectrum. Might not be a deal breaker for most, but Skoda definitely knows a thing or two about creating room, so we expected more.INTERIOR:On getting inside, the dual-tone interiors that greet us are soothing to look at. Every aspect of the interiors looks strictly functional and gives the car an old-school charm. The build quality also feels very solid. The front seats have solid support all round, with a height-adjustable center armrest. The height-adjustable driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat coupled with a steering wheel adjustable for rake and reach make the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat a very comfortable place to be in.The instrument cluster has a simple two dial layout with display in between for additional information. Steering mounted controls feel solid, so does the leather-wrapped steering wheel itself. The center console is a standard affair, with the infotainment system having all the latest tech-wizardry. Lack of a touchscreen however betrays the car\xe2\x80\x99s age in an otherwise great interior. There are chrome linings at various places on the center console and steering wheel for added elegance. Top end variants get Automatic Climate Control too. The new automatic gearbox for the diesel variants was one of the significant changes made during the 2014 update. The Shifter flaunts the presence of this famed DSG gearbox by having the initials etched on it. The all-black knob with a lining of chrome feels very ergonomic to use. A 12V port in front of it flanked by two cubby holes round out the features here.The rear seats are also quite roomy, with rear AC vents enhancing the comfort levels. The fifth occupant may feel a bit cramped during short journeys and for longer journeys the Rapid is definitely a four-seater only.Storage spaces overall are more than ample. You have cup holders with flip frames at the front and rear. Standard bottle holders on all doors, cubby holes below the front armrest and in the centre console are sure to address all your needs.PERFORMANCE:There are two engine options for the Rapid, a 1.6L MPI petrol and 1.5 TDI diesel. Both engine options have a manual and an automatic variant.PETROL:The petrol engine puts out 105bhp at 5250 rpm and 153 Nm of torque at 3800 rpm. The engine is not exactly the most responsive one in this segment. However it does accelerate well and the torque also feels a bit higher throughout its rev range. The 5-speed manual gearbox is definitely one of the smoothest we have seen. It has short throws and the gearing is clever enough to cover up for the engine\xe2\x80\x99s shortfalls. The 6-speed automatic does make things interesting by having a S mode for more Sporty behaviour. However, its regular mode (D-mode) feels quite laggy and is best suited for bumper-to-bumper traffic only. Chasing triple-digit speeds and overtaking feels more convenient in the S mode.Diesel:The diesel has been downsized from 1.6L to 1.5L after the 2014 update. But it still continues to generate the same 105bhp@4400rpm and 250Nm@1500-2500rpm that the larger engine generated. The torque is certainly at the higher end of the spectrum in this segment, the highest being 260Nm generated by the 1.6L diesel in the Verna. Since this torque is available right from 1500rpm, the diesel does feel light on its feet. However, the refinement levels feel a bit lacking at higher rpms as the engine can get disturbingly noisy. This comes as quite a surprise to us, as this was not the case for the earlier, larger engine.The 5-speed manual is a great match for this engine and can make both city driving and highway cruising a breeze. The star however, is the newly introduced DSG box. This is a 7-speed box used in the Vento diesel and not the 6-speed box used in the Octavia. This too has the S and D modes like the petrol does. But in this case, the D-mode was much better, with the shifts happening fast and there was no sluggishness at all! It makes best use of the torque available across a wide rpm range and keeps you on the move irrespective of the speed. The S mode, as expected, is good for highway driving but can prove a bit too jumpy and difficult to drive in the city as the throttle is much more sensitive. Also, the engine stays at higher revs for longer in S mode and this does not bode very well for the TDI as it can get quite whiny.RIDE AND HANDLING:The Rapid has different setups for the Diesel and the Petrol versions. The diesel has its suspension setup on the stiffer side as expected, but what was not expected was the ease with which it could glide over potholes even with a stiffer suspension. At the same time, this same stiffness ensured that the vehicle remains planted around turns and over any major potholes even at high speeds. Body roll is very well controlled. The petrol on the other hand, was effective at normal speeds, soaking in bumps very easily. At highway speeds however, the soft suspension led to too much movement and did not inspire confidence like the diesel. The suspension and the TDI+DSG combo make the Diesel version of the Rapid a much better car to drive. Braking was top notch on both petrol and diesel variants.SAFETY:Skoda has always been considered as the more premium brand as compared to its plain-jane VW cousins. In keeping with this image, it has ensured that all its vehicles have the safety features that a premium badge commands. Dual front airbags are standard across all variants, with ABS and ESC being offered for all variants except the base one. ESC is offered only for diesel automatic transmission. Other features like fuel supply cut-off in crash, Reverse parking distance control (Parktronic) and a sound-based warning signal for excess speed are also built into the vehicle for better safety.VARIANTS:As you can see, Skoda has covered most bases in the base Active variant itself and by the time you reach the mid-level variant, you have most bells and whistles you require. But the gearbox, engine and variant combinations can get a little confusing here, so let us break it down for you.If you are going for an automatic vehicle, the diesel is a no-brainer. Going for the Ambition variant should give you good value for money. The major things you might miss out on will be the Halogen headlamps, Cruise control and Automatic climate control. If you are going for a manual transmission, the petrol has one of the smoothest gearboxes around. So that should be your choice if you want pure driving pleasure. If practicality is also in mind, you can go for Ambition trim for diesel too.One interesting thing about the Rapid is the Black Package that is being offered at a premium of Rs. 13,000. This trim looks really great and is definitely worth the money in our opinion, if you are willing to spend it. Obligatory picture of this beautiful machine below. \xe2\x80\x9cWicked\xe2\x80\x9d is the word you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for.VERDICT:When looking at the Rapid, you would start off with its closest competitor, the Vento. It is basically the same car underneath but offers much more value. In terms of the segment in which it sits, the build is top notch and performance figures are sufficient to excite you. The only down sides we see is the feature list. However, the bigger concern is the after sales service of Skoda. '

sS'Chevrolet Cruze'
p283
S"Introduction:Chevrolet has made some decent ground in the Indian market, and models such as Cruze help to strengthen the company's position here. Cruze had been received with a decent response in the market, although it was not nearly as good as it had performed in International markets. With the Indian market confined to regional players, and anchored to a selective price range, a whole range of factors fuel the vehicle's less than overwhelming response. We're here to scavenge all we can from the Chevrolet Cruze, and find out exactly where it let the score down, and where it knocked it off the park.Pros:1. Stunning exterior look.2. Host of comfort and entertainment facilities to keep the occupants engaged.Cons:1. The performance could use an upgrade.2. Its price range is sure to trim its column of potential buyers.Stand-Out Features:1. The My-Link 7-inch Infotainment System is one of the few things that truly awe you about this car.2. Its handling is particularly good, giving just about any type of driver the time of his life.Overall:It's safe to say that the vehicle does boast some unique impressions of its own, from a stylish look to a luxurious cabin to passable performance. Chrome highlights, an agile shape and a well balanced profile together make the Cruze gracious and good looking. Underneath the skin, it comes with a mediocre cabin that is treated for a lush and engaging appeal. The black and titanium colour scheme makes for a holistic aura, and occupants are sure to feel enriched by the modern and sophisticated layout of the instruments. The cornerstone of the entire ride, if you ask us, would be the entertainment facilities, from the Infotainment system to the integrated radio system. The machine has been powered with a 2.0-litre diesel engine, and the Cruze comes fitted with some strong safety aids such as ABS/EBD, dual airbags, child anchoring and many more.Exteriors:A glance at the Chevrolet Cruze and you're likely to be left with a crackling, racy impression. We're sure that the vehicle's slender build, low profile and sporty edge meld to make it a phenomenon among youngsters. There's no doubt that it does absorb some influences from mainstream models, but Chevrolet has also given it its own distinct touch with the classy look along with some rich themes.At the front, the sharp face is great looking, and the swept back headlamps add to the aggressive effect. The dual port front grille comes along with the golden Chevrolet bowtie, and we thought this alone injected some more glam' into the front. The chrome flavour of the grille, along with the dual bezel highlight on the headlamps together sew some lavishness into the design.The gentle metallic skin wraps over the bottom-side, leaving strong design lines that flow outwards for a more prominent demeanour.The side of the vehicle is given its prominence with the subtle wheel arches, well-sculpted alloy wheels, and the serene body lines that run through the door side. You can feel a more plush effect permeate the vehicle's image with the chrome garnished window sill and the chrome door handles. The outside mirrors are body colored, and we thought this aligns with the overall look well.The overall structure of the machine is balanced with a larger rear portion, and this gives it a streamlined, agile build that is sure to get heads turning. The metallic skin blankets around the rear wheel arches in a flawless manner, giving a more puffed up look to the back of the vehicle. The refined curves flow all the way into the rear side, making for a more aesthetic, visionary look.You can tell that the company feasts on luxury delights, with a thin chrome garnish at the centre of the trunk. The slick looking tail-lamps stretch all the way from the inside of the truck and expand into the side profile, and we found this design brilliant. The ol' Chevy emblem rests by the top of the trunk, finishing off the magic with a more distinguished effect.Interiors:The cabin is reasonably spacious, and when placed aside rival sedans, it probably goes a notch or two up. Taller and broader occupants could have mild complaints, but all in all, the machine can comfortably house five normal adults. For the front occupants, there is decent space for you to stretch your legs, while the rear could use some more. Headroom does fall short slightly, and if you're in a taller range, you might have to put up with a constricted feeling.Being a Chevy vehicle, you're more than justified in seeking the most sensuous, luxurious appeal in here. We'll let you know that we felt marvellous sitting in here. The Corvette inspired dual cockpit design had our jaws dropping and the premium black and titanium wraparound theme further instilled some beauty into the space.The vibrant feeling you get when you sit in here is further boosted by a pulse of sophistication and glamour. The advanced looking centre console and steering wheel together capture any average man's attention. This goes in perfect harmony with the black environment and the silver accents. The dashboard slopes down from the top and fuses into the glove box at the bottom. Circular AC vents are pressed into the corners of the dash, and rectangular vents flow downwards on both sides of the centre console.The console makes for a more energetic aura, with a unique, sliding-down 'V' shape and metallic highlights that compliment the black colour treatment. Integrated at the top of the console is a My-Link Touch screen Infotainment system with the buttons batched below. We thought that the 7-inch screen looked far better than in the previous version, which looked nearly outdated. Well below the audio, switches for the climate control facility have been stacked, right in front of the 6-speed gearbox.The steering wheel comes with the same sporty design that most vehicles employ today, but we've got to add that it felt remarkably good to hold. Buttons for the audio system, Bluetooth, voice recognition as well as cruise control have been wired into the wheel, and the Chevrolet emblem rests by the centre for a more distinctive image.Ahead, the triple pod instrument cluster comes with an icy blue illumination, and this renews the modern tone of the place.The Monotone Jet black seats come with Titanium stitch highlights does play up to the cabin atmosphere. We won't lie to you, the seating is remarkably good, and the leather upholstery further enriches the experience.Headrests have been incorporated for added convenience. At the front, the armrests come with a storage area and a sliding lid, while the rear armrest is built with cup holders. We thought that the design fed on themes and influences used in modern cars today, but there was some ingenuity in the overall make-up and for this, we'll give the interiors a pass.Performance:Packed within the car is a 2.0-litre diesel engine that displaces 1998cc. It has 4 cylinders and 16 valves wired together through the double overhead camshaft arrangement. The engine has seen an upgrade from its previous version, and its current specs are stronger and healthy. With a power of 164bhp at 3800rpm and a torque of 360Nm at 2000rpm, it notches up 16bhp and 53Nm more than its predecessor. We found driving in traffic a rather dreary affair, and the engine doesn't bulk up anywhere before 2000rpm. Nevertheless, torque delivery is neater and better spread in this new version. Acceleration feels smooth and responsive, and you'd be swept to the back of your seat when flooring the gas pedal. The brunt of the engine is carried by the front wheels, and yet, the torque steer didn't seem too rash or out of control. The engine is meshed with a 6-speed manual transmission that makes shifting a reasonably easy job.Handling:We thought that the company left no stone unturned with respect to the chassis arrangement. The Cruze\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2s front arm has been compounded with a McPerson strut, and this is further enhanced with the a linear cylindrical coil spring and a tubular stabilizer bar system. Meanwhile, the rear axle has a compound crank type system, and it comes along with a non linear mini block coil spring. In addition to this, twin tube gas type shock absorbers also help to offer a comfortable, strain free ride. When you're in this vehicle, you're sure to feel more relieved than in other home made vehicles, and we'll give the company props for that. Subtle bumps and jerks are to be expected nevertheless, but you're not going to be tossed about within the car as you would be with some other vehicles. Cornering and stopping is also a neat affair, with the present of strong discs at the front as well as the rear. We thought that the front wheel drive format of the vehicle was a core factor in the harmonious handling, though drivers with a heavier taste might feel awkward adjusting to this.Safety:The company has made no compromise with safety for the Cruze. You're likely to feel more relaxed and at ease here inside this vehicle than most others, with a slew of security elements blanketing the car. This includes the ABS, dual front airbags, side airbags, child mounting seat provisions, underbody coating, a dual electric horn, battery run down protection and height adjustable front seatbelts. Anti theft alarm, an immobilizer and programmable auto door locking facility affirm the security of the vehicle as well, in addition to the occupants. What really impressed us about the safety provisions was the fact that all of them were made available for all trims.Variants:The model comes in two trim levels: LT and LTZ. LT comes with a nominal list of features, including power steering, a tropicalised electronic auto air conditioning system, an integrated audio system with USB, Aux-In and MP3, steering mounted audio controls, power adjustable outside mirrors, power windows with an express down function, a sunglass holder and a remote door lock facility. Meanwhile, the higher end LTZ has been imbued with a far more relishing air, with a 7-inch My-Link Touch screen Infotainment system, an internet radio function, SIRI EYES FREE compatibility, Bluetooth audio streaming facility, a rear view camera incorporated into the Touch screen display, and touch controls for the automatic HVAC personalization settings. We'll admit that the LTZ variant is pretty fancy, but if you're looking to cut short on your spending by curbing your comfort, then we'd recommend the LT trim for you. But if high quality comfort is your primary need, then LTZ would be suited for you.Verdict:We'll admit, this car did go further than most others with its merits. A powerful exterior, well styled interior, a range of entertainment and comfort features and a decent handling capacity together solidify its position as a preferable choice for many of today's buyers. On the downside, however, customers have to bear an immense cost, just passable performance and lack of space on the inside. In the end of the day, if you're willing to shell out quite a lot of money for a classy vehicle with style, charisma and comfort, then the Cruze is a choice you wouldn't regret. But if you're a more reserved buyer, and if you can trade comfort for a reasonable price, then we would suggest that you head elsewhere."

sS'Jeep Grand Cherokee'
p285
S"Introduction:Jeep has got a firm footing in markets around the world. The company has had a less-than-average position here in India, and its clear that the brand's gearing up to set this right. At the Auto Expo 2016, the brand showcased its upcoming launch for the market, the muscular new Grand Cherokee. As we took a look at the machine, we felt overwhelmed by the bold, menacing design and the smooth build. Information about the machine has been widely circulated, but there are bits and pieces to it that we had to put together from speculation and guesswork. Pros:1. Intimidating exterior design, something very few can turn down. 2. Customers would love the wide range of comfort and entertainment features within it.  Cons:1. The lack of some features across all variants could deter appeal for some. 2. Its heavy size takes a toll on the balance and handling at high speeds. Stand-out Features:1. A large field of aid programs such as ABS, ESC Hill hold assist and many others together make for a secure, well shielded drive. 2. It comes with a truly massive boot area, and this is be a definite thumbs-up for many customers,Overall:The vehicle is said to come with both petrol and diesel variants, with a 6.4-litre V8 engine for the petrol trim, and a 3.0-litre V6 engine on the diesel side. We expect some brazen performance figures that we're sure will surpass most other SUVs in the domestic market. Its inner comfort looks promising as well, with many features such as a Touchscreen system, a Harman Kardon 19-speaker system, a 7-inch LCD instrument cluster, leather dressed seats, power adjustment for the seats, and many others. All in all, even prior to its launch, this vehicle has got us curious and waiting for more, and we'd agree that many other auto-enthusiasts feel the same. Exteriors:This here, ladies and gents, is a monster. One glance at its tall, muscular design is enough to leave you with a breathless impression. We'll be honest here, never before have we laid eyes on a vehicle with such a pronounced, masculine characteristic, which is, at the same time, imbibed with a delicate, feminine touch. The overall composition of the body reflects a balanced layout, and this certainly does hike up its appeal. Its profile has a streamlined element that most people would find attractive, for it does add a sporty touch to the overall look. At the front, it wears a massive grille that comes with some noticeable silver elements for a more rejuvenated look. The front portion has been imbued with a more charismatic and powerful expression with the wide front skirt that drapes down all the way to the lower bumper. A large air intake section at the bottom of the skirt harmonises the entire image, and we thought it fit perfectly into the look. On either side of the grille, there are attractive headlamps that come with all necessary lighting units. Moving upwards, the hood spreads over a large area, and when you stand before the vehicle, you can feel an exalting, majestic demeanour with this. The refined curvatures that flow inwards into the hood added a rich touch to the design, and we'll tell you here itself that it's small aspects such as these that bring out the younger car lover in you. The windscreen has been swept back, and we could feel a strong aerodynamic agility here, allowing the right airflow when driving. On the side, the region surrounding the wheels comes with a more heavily toned effect, and we loved the distinctive impression this creates. The heavy lines that streak the door-sides are gorgeous, and the well sculpted body cladding adds to the vibrant effect. The roofline of the vehicle slides upwards, engaging a more beefed up rear area. The tail-lamps on either side of the boot trail into the side portion, and we thought this struck a rather good look. The fine lines that run through the boot-side add to the refined look, while at the base, the sporty exhaust pipes pack a more thrilling look that we know few people would turn down.Interiors:We've glossed through some photos on the web and gathered all we could about the machine. The cabin is more spacious than most people would desire. At the front, you're given more than enough room to stretch your legs out, while headroom and shoulder room are also fine. The second row could have been improved slightly according to some sources, although it's quite possibly more comfort-oriented than most other SUVs of its class. The layout and styling of the cabin is pretty marvellous, but you might want to keep your expectations in check, because it's not the type that you'd find within Audi/BMW/Mercedes-Benz. We definitely adored it, with the fine treatment and the expensive highlights. There is an edge of sophistication that you can trace in the design, and we personally thought it was very well done. We aren't too sure about the colour scheme, but we get the idea that there could be a two two colour scheme. At the front, the upper section of the dashboard is to come in a lighter colour, while the lower portion that flows down towards the leg area would be darker. AC vents are present on either side of the dash, and on either side of the console by the centre. A thick wooden garnish runs the length of the dashboard, stretching into the doorsides as well. This definitely does rake up the glamour within, and we thought that it was unlike other models that we see today. At the focus of the console is a 8.4-inch Touchscreen display with the buttons aligned below it. The placement and arrangement of the system was great, bringing a modern pulse to the interior that most people would find enthralling.The area surrounding the console is wrapped in the same silver embellishment, making for a more opulent and energetic look. At the bottom of the console, the gear-shift lever has been placed right next to a bottle storage region. By the corner, the steering wheel is to come with fine leather dressing, and we're sure few people would turn down this thrill. Paddle shifters have been incorporated by the wheel, allowing for easier shifting. Coming to the seating arrangement, you're sure to love the black leather upholstery that lavishes the seats, and it comes along with Suede inserts for a more affluent touch. When you take a seat here, you're sure to feel more relieve than in most other cars, with the strong ergonomic design, along with many reliable comfort facilities. This includes seat heating, 4-way adjustable lumbar support, split folding for the rear seats, and ventilation for the front seats. With all of these and more, we can safely say that riding in this vehicle, upon its release, is going to be quite a breeze.Performance:Diesel:Meagre information about the specs are available on the net. On the diesel side, the machine comes along with a 3.0-litre V6 EcoDiesel engine. Reliable sources place its power somewhere around     700bhp, and this makes the vehicle quite the monster. It is known to come along with an 8-speed Paddle-Shift automatic transmission, and we're sure that shifting couldn't get easier than with something like this. The vehicle's drive is said to be strong and confident, with an easy cruising and sprinting capacity, together with a sound acceleration as well. We're sure that most Indians would love to get their hands on a machine such as this, with good performance along with a reliable handling to come along with it. Petrol:On the petrol front, the vehicle comes along with a 6.4-litre V8 engine, and this gives you some pretty raw performance.  It pumps out a healthy 474bhp, and is meshed with the same 8-speed automatic gearbox. We hear that the machine can zoom from 0 to 100kmph in just 4.8 seconds, and we've got to tell you folks, that is a pretty intense figure for a vehicle of this size and structure.  Ride and Handling:Like we do in our other reviews, we weren't able to ride the vehicle personally. But we did unveil a lot about its inner infrastructure, and we can't say we weren't impressed. A steel suspension is present for two of the lower end variants, while an active damping suspension is present for the top end trim. A conventional front axle differential, along with a conventional rear axle differential has been equipped onto both arms of the chassis, helping to further bolster stability and handling. An electro-hydraulic power steering system augments the handling, and we hear that the steering response is just as clean as a driver could want it to be. Its rugged composition is sure to relieve occupants of the regular road hassles that come from potholes and other road anomalies. Passengers on the inside could feel occasional hitters with the more punishing road formats found in our country, but the overall ride quality is said to be okay. As for the braking part, 4-wheel disc brakes help to ease out the halting and cornering process, ensuring that you meet little strain during tighter situations. A low level of body roll is naturally expected, given the vehicle's bulky size, but we're confident that conventional Indian audiences can take it without breaking a sweat. Safety:We're happy to tell you that the list of safety facilities is massive in this vehicle, and most people would have no reservations about the security set-up when seated in here. Strong drive programs help strengthen the drive, including the ABS, rain brake support, ready alert braking, hill start assist, hill descent control and electronic stability control. The more conventional list includes a keyless entry system, remote keyless entry security alarm, airbags by the front as well as the side, park view rear back-up camera, front passenger seatbelt assist and many more. Altogether, we've got to tell you, there's very little that the vehicle lacks in terms of safety, and this is sure to come as one of the model's strongest aspects for its buyers. Variants:The model series is expected to come with three trim levels, Limited, Summit and SRT. Of these, Limited is the entry level variant, and it comes with a passable list of features, including a 5.0-inch Touchscreen display, 6 speakers, dual USB ports for charging, an integrated voice command that comes along with Bluetooth, a remote SD card slot, 3-point centre rear seatbelts, 4-wheel traction control and many more. Meanwhile, the mid variant, Summit, comes with a rear seat dual screen Blue ray/DVD player, GPS Navigation, 9 amplified speakers with a subwoofer, a ParkSense park assist system, leather trimmed perforated seats that come along with edge welting, and ventilation system for the front seats. The high end variant, SRT has it all, people. You get an SRT high performance audio system, 5-spoke wheels, an electronic rear limited-slip differential system, a Selec-track system and many more that's sure to woo anyone to step into the ride.Verdict:We'll be honest with you, it's hard to judge a vehicle with such amazing depth. The Grand Cherokee is displaying promise like no other vehicle has, and its response in other markets is pretty good. We're sure that a major class of Indian car lovers would enjoy this vehicle's enthralling exteriors, luxurious interiors and the never ending list of comfort. Its handling and performance would charm the sportier section of the crowd, and youngsters would definitely love the overall style and glamour. In the end of the day, we're going to have to wait for the machine to be launched here before we can ascertain whether it's destined to fly or to flop."

sS'Ferrari 488'
p299
S'Ferrari 458 Speciale, the most extreme road-legal from Ferrari has been unveiled at the Frankfurt Motor Show September this year. If we watch it from a naked eye, it appears nothing more than a regular 458 but the content hidden underneath says the whole story making this supercar truly worthy of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeciale\xe2\x80\x9d insignia. The new model from Ferrari is innovation to new active aerodynamic and traction modification technologies to make it the fastest and capable Ferrari roadster to grace a track. It sports very interesting specs under the hood retaining the same but slightly tuned 4.5L V-8 powertrain from the base 458 Italia. It generates massive power of 596hp and 540Nm of torque. However the torque value remains the same as in the base 458, its horsepower has been increased by 34hp. Ferrari has been claiming this as the highest figure ever achieved by a naturally aspirated road car engine which edges it closer to its opponent McLaren 12c (616bhp). The engine is coupled with a seven-speed F1 dual clutch paddle-shift transmission gearbox. This great combination allows this beast to achieve 100kmph in mere 3 seconds of time reaching the top speed of 325kmph which Ferrari claims the highest lateral acceleration in any of its roadsters. This supercar also features a new Side Slip Angle Control System that instantly senses oversteering and automatically manages torque delivery and distribution via Formula 1-Trac traction control and E-Diff electronic differential. The advance combination of tailored Michelin Pilot Sport Cup2 tyres helps in improving balance and traction. The braking system has also been upgraded with the introduction of new calipers inspired from LaFerrari. Not only this, Ferrari 458 Speciale also shows its improved emission ratings with 275g CO2/km against 307g CO2/km in 458 coupe. The first and foremost thing that to be noticed in this cranked-up 458 Speciale is its graceful red paint job and combination of blue and white stripes lying on it giving it a stunning look. Front fascia of the car has been given much treatment with more sculptured bonnet giving more room for ventilation. It now features a reverse-vented hood which permits free air flow and help reduce drag. Rear has striking similarity to the racecar with larger diffuser and dual integrated exhaust pipes replacing the standard 458\xe2\x80\x99s trio tailpipes. Ferrari in its latest offering has installed a heavily tailored front skirt which it has named \xe2\x80\x9cmoveable aerodynamics\xe2\x80\x9d that increases downforce and help in lower dragging. As per other aerodynamic enhancing mods, they can be seen easily seen as on the outer edges of the front clothing, a wide opening and reverse-vented hood. In addition to this, Ferrari also reduced this supercar\xe2\x80\x99s weight to 1290kg from stock weight of 1380kg. The interiors of the car follow the architecture of Italia with a few elegant and purposeful modifications. Sabelt racer seats are affixed featuring standard carbon-fiber shells with presence of Alcantara. The glovebox and carpets have been omitted. The steering wheel inside are perfectly carved holding loads of buttons without any ordinary audio and cruise controlling functions. The lower right of the car, there is housed in a carbon fiber insert, the red Manetinno commutator switch that controls all five performance settings. The lower left holds Scarlet engine start key, when pushed coughs to life like a challenging monster clearing the throat after waking from a deep sleep. As far as instrument cluster is concerned, it has received a yellow-face treatment displaying \xe2\x80\x9c458 Speciale\xe2\x80\x9d on the screen. Ferrari claims that some of the first time introduced innovative features will make way for its future road cars to come with SSC and active aerodynamic dead certs. The core engineering philosophy revolves around pushing the cover with each new model and at the same time maintaining the inherent chassis balance and handling, ensuring that even amateur can get maximum driving pleasure. As far as competition is concerned, the newest addition from Ferrari will lock horns with Lamborghini Gallardo Squadra Corse 2013. As for now, unfortunately the model presented by Ferrari is a concept model to show off future technology to its potential buyers, so we are not expecting this prancing horse hitting our showrooms soon. But it is sure that Ferrari will release Speciale\xe2\x80\x99s price and production number soon and it is expected to bear a price tag of around US$ 400,000 (INR. 25204800.00).'

sS'Mahindra NuvoSport'
p303
S"Over the years, Mahindra has established itself as an SUV specialist. With a line-up that includes everything from a rugged and utilitarian Bolero to a plush and modern XUV500, Mahindra wants to make sure there\xe2\x80\x99s an SUV for every kind of customer. With the NuvoSport, Mahindra will be looking to plug the gap between the KUV100 and the TUV300. The NuvoSport is essentially a re-styled version of Mahindra\xe2\x80\x99s first sub 4 metre SUV, the Quanto.The NuvoSport is a sub 4 metre compact SUV, based on the Quanto, which in-turn was based on the Xylo. However, it now shares it's platform with the new Scorpio. The design is a last ditch attempt at salvaging the Quanto and is typically Mahindra (read: quirky). The most noticeable change is the updated face. The Xylo look alike fascia has been ditched in favour of a more aggressive and \xe2\x80\x98in your face\xe2\x80\x99 styling. The split headlamps are sure to grab some attention. The daytime running lights form an \xe2\x80\x98eyebrow\xe2\x80\x99 over the main lamps, which we think looks rather cool. The updated bumper brings some brawn to the profile. Mahindra has stuck to the tried and tested formula of using matte black appliques and a silver skidplate for the SUV look. The side and the rear remains relatively unchanged. Changes that immediately catch the eye are the updated 16\xe2\x80\x9d alloy wheels and the new tail-lamps. Other than these, the NuvoSport remains identical to the outgoing Quanto.While the interiors look identical to the Quanto in terms of design, Mahindra has infused certain modern elements to keep it up to speed with the times. It gets a new black and grey color palette which looks rather dull. We\xe2\x80\x99d have loved to see an all-black interior or maybe even a beige and black combo. Updates to the interior include a new 6.2-inch touchscreen audio system with Bluetooth, USB and FM support. The system is the exact same Kenwood unit found in the Ssangyong Rexton SUV. The controls for the air-conditioning system have also been replaced with circular knobs. Mahindra could have included an automatic climate control for the price. Both, the Vitara Brezza and the Ford EcoSport offer automatic climate control. The steering is now identical to the one on the TUV300 and features mounted controls. The steering can be adjusted for rake. The NuvoSport continues to be a 7-seater, just like its predecessor. Only the TUV300 gets a similar 5+2 seating arrangement. Space in the first two rows are more than adequate, with legroom and headroom being generous. The jump seats in the third row are best left to kids. You can even fold the jump seats down and recline the second row. This will be a boon on those long road-trips. Speaking of road-trips, the boot is rated at 412-litres. It can be further extended by using the 60:40 split on the rear bench. Tuck the rear seats away altogether, and what you get is 850-litres of space. There are plenty of storage spaces around the cabin too. For instance, there are a couple of cupholders near the gear-lever, bottle holders in the doorpads and even a nifty sunglass holder. Overall, the  NuvoSport does feature a really practical interior. It scores high on space and equipment offered. However, quality isn\xe2\x80\x99t the best around. The Vitara Brezza and the Ford EcoSport both feel better built. The engine is the same as the one on the TUV. However, it runs a different tune with better specs on paper when compared to the TUV. The change is not really astronomical. The engine has been badged the mHAWK 100. With 100bhp and 240Nm on tap, it is the most powerful compact SUV on sale today. The engine has an eco option where the engine is toned down to 73bhp & 180Nm of torque that keeps the fuel economy in check. The Ford Ecosport comes in a very close second at 99bhp/215Nm.In terms of the all important fuel consumption, the NuvoSport\xe2\x80\x99s ARAI efficiency stands at 17.45kmpl.The torque kicks in at a relatively low 1600rpm. This help get a move on in bumper to bumper traffic. The other thing that will assist you is the relatively light clutch.The other option is to pickup the NuvoSport without a clutch as it is on offer in an AMT (Automatic) variant. As most AMT\xe2\x80\x99s are plagued with the issue of delayed shifts, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t surprised when the issue appeared in the NuvoSport too. Don\xe2\x80\x99t drive the NuvoSport too enthusiastically and it will keep you happy.What is one of the biggest improvements is the ride & handling. The NuvoSport\xe2\x80\x99s chassis is based on the Scorpio.When compared to the Quanto, the NuvoSport sees improvement in terms of dynamics. With an updated suspension, the body roll is now in check and the car inspires a lot more confidence when compared to its predecessor.The noise levels too are an improvement. The engine is smooth and the amount of noise filtering into the cabin is in check.As to how the NuvoSport takes on the rough surfaces and speed bumps that you face on a daily basis, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to hold our verdict till the point when we get our hands on it for a comprehensive drive.Just like Mahindra\xe2\x80\x99s latest offerings, we expect ABS & EBD to be standard across the range. Dual airbags will be optional with every variant.The NuvoSport is an attractive package, especially for the people looking for a comfortable city runner. The updated design is catchy and the upgrades to the chassis and suspension puts it miles ahead of the Quanto. It also has oodles of space on the inside and an upgraded safety list.We only got a chance to take the NuvoSport out for a short spin and we\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to you after our comprehensive drive. On the surface, this package sure looks promising."

This engine is mated with a fully automatic transmission system that helps in delivering a decent performance. On a full charge, this vehicle can deliver a mileage of 120 kilometers. An hour of charging can take this small car to 20 Kms, which seems pretty decent. On the whole, this vehicle takes 5 hours (on top end variant) for a full charge and 4 hours (for its base level trim).The motor of the base variant takes almost four hours for a full charge, which helps in delivering a mileage of 80 Kilometers. However, for running 25 Kms, it takes 1 hour of charging time, which is quite good. While the top end variant takes about 5 hours to deliver a maximum mileage of 120 Kilometers, which is rather impressive for this class. At the same time, it can run for 20 kilometers for which it requires only an 1 hour of charging.

sS'Datsun GO'
p317
S'IntroductionNissan as a brand is known world-wide for making cheap and cheerful small cars. However, in India; which happens to be amongst the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest small car markets, the Japanese brand hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite gained as much traction as they were hoping to. To fix this and further their reach, they decided to move lower down the price chain. They brought back the iconic century old brand Datsun from retirement as a budget brand for developing countries such as India. India was the first country to get the taste of the new Datsun car, the Go. The hatch is based on the same platform as the Nissan Micra but built to a cost. There are many expectations as to whether the Datsun will turn the tide for Nissan and will the Go dethrone the Alto?Pros1. Generous dimensions. Liberates a lot of space on the interior.\n2. Segment leading power and performance. The 1.2 litre motor is super peppy!\n3. Mature ride quality, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get upset by the bumps and potholes easily.Cons1. Interiors look boring, outdated and not to mention cheap!\n2. Obvious cost-cutting shines through non-retractable rear seat belts, glove box lid etc.\n3. Noise insulation is non-existent. You will hear the tyres, the engine and everything that is around the car on the move.Stand-out features1. Segment-best boot space.\n2. First-in-segment features like follow-me headlamps.ExteriorWhen we said Nissan wanted to go down through Datsun that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t clearly mean smaller. The Datsun Go fits better in the larger B segment rather than the A segment it\xe2\x80\x99s destined for judging by the size. The overall design of the exterior of the Datsun Go is follows a \xe2\x80\x98please-everyone-offend-no-one\xe2\x80\x99 theme.The front of the Go is where it looks the best thanks to the large headlamps, the dab of chrome on the grille, muscular front bumper and the sculpted bonnet.The sculpted bonnet neatly integrates into the front bumper, which does have space for hosting fog lamps but are given a miss to keep the costs in check.To the side, three character lines run the length of the car. One starts from the headlamps and flows under the windows onto the tail lamps, where it gets a slight twitch. While another line runs in the middle of the car, a third line connects the wheels at the bottom.The outside rear view mirrors (ORVMs) are not even body coloured even in the top variant and there is no stalks to manually adjust the ORVMs from inside. Get ready to roll down the windows every time.The rear of the Datsun Go looks simple but good with large tail lamps and the rear bumper gets a neat cut for the number plate.While the wheel arches are mammoth, the 13-inch 155/70 profile look puny under them, leaving wide gaps between the tyres and the arches.InteriorsAll that size of the Go translates to a spacious cabin. But of course you will have to overcome the cheapness you will feel as soon as you enter. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get us wrong, the build quality and the way things are put together are on par with the segment but the Hyundai Eon feels Eons better, pun intended. Apart from that, things like the non-retractable rear seat belts, thin seats and uncovered glove box open up the question of how much cost-cutting went in the car.The interiors get a grey layout with a lighter shade of grey for the bottom of the dashboard. The over design of the dashboard is very simple and many things like the indicator stalks, AC vents etc are borrowed from Nissan Micra.A very simple instrument cluster comprises of a very large speedometer (no tachometer) and a MID. The MID offers a wide range of information like tachometer, odometer, tripmeter, distance to empty and average fuel economy.Though simple, the steering wheel is of nice size and feels light. The horn pad is big but the horn itself is a poor sounding single unit. The gear lever and the handbrake find their place on the dashboard instead of the conventional in-between the seats one. Though the gear lever is ergonomic once you get used to it, many will not like the placement of the gear lever and the old style pull and twist handbrake.The centre console gets two AC vents, an unusual audio setup and HVAC controls below. The switches and knobs are of good size and quality. The glove box is deep but comes without a closing lid. The same thing happened with the Nissan Evalia, which later got one, but the Go comes open only. Other storage spaces include smaller cubby holes under the steering wheel (none of them are closed) and bottle holders on the front doors.Coming to the seat setup, the Datsun gets a connected seat, which is almost bench type seats you get in old HM Ambassadors. You can\xe2\x80\x99t seat another person as there is neither the space nor any seatbelt. Datsun has said that this space can be used for storage space which sort of defeats the purpose of having a \xe2\x80\x98seat\xe2\x80\x99 and not usable cubby holes.Though the seats are thin, they offer good support. Having the longest wheelbase in its segment (longer than some in a segment above too), the Go offers excellent space, especially in the rear. Three adults can travel in reasonable comfort in the rear, when compared to the constricted space of the competition.Segment leading 265 litres of boot space is more than generous. Being trumped by only the Kwid.PerformanceThe Datsun Go is available only in a petrol version and we at CarDekho.com believe Datsun should have offered a diesel version too, to stand ahead of the competition.The Datsun Go is powered by an 1198 cc, 3-cylinder petrol engine that puts out 67 bhp of maximum power at 5000 rpm and 104 Nm of maximum torque at 4000 rpm. It is the same unit that powers the Micra Active. The engine is the biggest in the segment in terms of size and also has the best-in-class power and performance.The budget cut comes out right from the moment you turn on the engine. The engine shudders evidently even in idle and the NVH levels are better not looked upon at all, as there is no evidence of sound proofing at all. But once you get going, the engine becomes smoother. The engine is good to clock triple digit speeds but as the speeds rise, so does the noise, typical of a three cylinder unit.Ride and HandlingThe Datsun Go handles almost all the irregularities of the Indian roads pretty well with only the large pot holes giving it the wobble. The suspension does a nice job of absorbing them but the absence of any kind of insulation means even though you won\xe2\x80\x99t feel the smallest of the disturbances of the roads, you will hear them.The light steering is good for the city driving and gains good weight on the highways at higher speeds. Straight line stability is good but an upgrade for the tyres is strictly recommended. Braking is satisfactory but without ABS, sudden braking made both the car and us nervous.SafetyThe safety is where the Datsun Go came under lots of fire but the company is now offering the driver side airbag as on option on the top variant.VariantsDatsun Go is available in three variants - D, A and T.The D is the most basic variant and comes with halogen headlamps, high mounted stop lamp, silver finish radiator grille, wheel cap, speed sensitive wipers, connected front seats, plain seat upholstery, speaker grille, MID, follow-me-home headlamps, remote fuel lid and tailgate opener, engine immobiliser and heater.The mid-variant A gives you chrome finish radiator grille, body colour bumper, passenger side ORVM, designed seat upholstery, door map pockets, AC, speed sensitive power steering.Top-end T adds full wheel cover, body coloured door handle, optional silver finish for steering wheel, front power windows, mobile docking station with Aux-in support, front speakers, manual central locking and optional driver side airbag.VerdictAs a car, the Datsun Go offers great design, amazing space, big engine and good driveability. If you need nothing more, the Go deserves a spot on your driveway. But as a package, it lacks features (some most basic ones) and the competition offers much more. You need to offer more especially when you want customers to opt for a completely new brand.'

sS'Audi Q3'
p321
S'IntroductionThe Audi Q3 has been on the Indian roads for quite a while now and has also seen a few updates, the most recent once being rolled out in mid-2015. It has been one of Audi\xe2\x80\x99s best-selling models in India and understandably so, considering the craze for affordable compact SUVs even in the higher end of the market. It was initially bought to compete with its German rivals in the luxury segment, but ended up dominating it. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what makes this premium SUV so successful and what has been added to it in its latest avatar. \nPros1. The quality of interiors is top notch as is expected from a vehicle in this segment. 2. Reliable and time-tested engine.3. Paddle shifters have been added to the automatic variants. Need we say more?Cons1. There is still lack of a few creature comforts like a touchscreen, central armrest at the  rear which should have been included.2. The cabin space in the rear can get quite cramped for three people.3. In terms of handling it does not do much to outdo its competitors, the GLA and the X1.Stand Out Features1. The newly offered \xe2\x80\x98Technology Pack\xe2\x80\x99 for the top end variant gives a plethora of features like Satellite Navigation, 20GB onboard hard drive, a new sound system and so on.2. There is a holder for your cellphone below the central armrest. Placing the phone here lets its use the car\xe2\x80\x99s antenna to receive signals, which in turn helps conserve the phone\xe2\x80\x99s battery life. That\xe2\x80\x99s some rocket science right there. \nOverview:The Audi Q3 mainly aims to attract the young buyers with this entry level model in its SUV lineup. It has been doing well so far, and the facelift only makes things better with some minor tweaks. The engine is still the 2.0L 4-cylinder TDI diesel that has two different states of tune. Soon, another car in the segment, the BMW X1 will be available in a refreshed version while the Mercedes Benz has not made any announcements regarding the GLA\xe2\x80\x99s update (it has entered only recently). The Q3 however, has been packed to the gills with the latest update and should have no problem competing against them. \nEXTERIORS:The Q3 maintains an aggressive stance while looking the part of a premium vehicle. It looks subtle and mature in terms of its design lines. Some may interpret this as boring, but it gives an overall aura of function over form.  The overall appearance is a bit like a coupe, which gives it a feel of compactness. Comparing it to the X1 and GLA, it  misses out on being the highest just by a few millimetres but length and width-wise it is the lowest. It neither pales nor dominates when compared, but is just good enough to compete.The new Q3 does not mark that much of a radical departure from its earlier designs. But wherever there are changes, they feel refreshing. On the front, the major overhaul is seen in the form of a redesigned grille. It still retains the iconic hexagonal shape, but the grille is now made of brushed aluminium and extends till the headlights giving the vehicle a feel of understated elegance. This is being called the \xe2\x80\x983D Grille\xe2\x80\x99 by Audi and is the new grille design for the whole \xe2\x80\x98Q\xe2\x80\x99 lineup of vehicles. Two creases run along the length of the hood, from roughly the middle of the headlamps to the A-pillars and give it a slightly muscular feel. The front bumper has also been redesigned a bit. There are parking sensors in the place of fog lamps and the shape of the black inserts in the bumper has also changed. The bottom lip of the bumper is slightly more angular with the refreshed skidplate complementing it. All this contributes to the overall look of ruggedness that the car exudes.On inspecting closely, we can see an internal rearrangement of the LED lights though the overall headlamp housing looks the same as the previous iteration from afar. The fog lights missing in the bumper have been integrated here.From the side too, the matured look is evident from the simple character lines that run across the car. The wheels have been redesigned from the previous iteration and frankly, these look a lot better. The window sill gets a chrome finish. The ORVMs can be auto-dimmed on the driver\xe2\x80\x99s side. The wheels are 16 inches for the S Edition variant and 17 inches for the Quattro variants. Accordingly, the tire sizes also vary, with the 215mm (215/65) tyres being used for the 16 inch wheels and 235mm (235/55) tyres being used for the 17 inch ones.Coming to the rear, we see the changes from one generation to the next become even more subtle. The overall shape of the rear fascia and taillights remains the same. The taillights have a wraparound design and a triangular shape giving them a sharp look. The bottom lip of the bumper again has a high stance along with a slightly redesigned diffuser. The exhaust have been given a chrome finish for a touch of elegance.The indicators in the rear taillights have a mechanism where they swipe in the direction in which the car is turning.The roof of the car has a panoramic glass roof that opens in two sections. Go ahead. Stick your head out. There are also a pair of chrome roof rails along the edges. This however, comes as standard only for the top-end variant.Boot space is a class leading 460 litres, far higher than the 420 litres that X1 and 421 litres that the GLA offers.INTERIORS:Interiors are of paramount importance for the overall image of the car, more so in the premium segment of the market. Interiors come in two colour options - all black and black and beige. Personally, we at Cardekho feel the all-black interiors look better. The seats come in black and beige colour options, draped in either leather or leatherette. They provide 4-way lumbar support for that plush seating experience. There is an adjustable armrest between the two front seats below which there is a cradle for a phone along with a USB port. Further below that, there is a storage space and the Audi music interface port at the bottom of it. Both front seats come with the complete electric adjustment but lack memory options. There are some smartly placed Aluminium inserts in the dashboard and the doors, which further enhance their appearance. The rear seat backrests can be folded in a 40:60 ratio or fully, for extra storage space.\nThe steering wheel is the same as the outgoing model. One significant addition to it are the column-mounted paddle shifters that come for the automatic gearboxes. Apart from that, it has buttons. Lots of buttons. The center console has all the different options for media that you might require. There is also buttons for selecting drive mode and engaging Hill Descent Control. The console also has drinks holders. An illuminated glove compartment can be found below the dash on the passenger side, though a chilled option would have been appreciated.The Instrument cluster now comes with a small screen in the center that gives the information from the MMI module. It also gives turn by turn navigation in the top variant, eliminating the need to completely look away from the road while following directions.There is an MMI screen that pops up from the dashboard over the center console. It is a high resolution 7\xe2\x80\x9d colour screen with high quality map view. It gives detailed route information on a splits creen. It also works as a parking assist rear camera with guidance lines changing in the direction of car motion, but only on the topmost variant you get this assist as well as the navigation option.The rear can get a bit cramped for three full adults, and the lack of an armrest here also feels dissatisfactory. Additional storage spaces inside the vehicle come in the form of a few pockets which are present on all the doors and mesh pockets present behind the front seats. A 1.5L bottle can conveniently fit in the door pockets.PERFORMANCE:The Q3 comes with the turbocharged 2.0L 4 cylinder diesel TDI engine from the previous generation in two different states of tune. The emissions comply with Euro IV norms.The base 30 TDI S Edition variant gets a tune that gives out 138.13bhp or power at 4200rpm and 320Nm of torque at 1750-2500rpm. This is mated to a 6 speed manual gearbox. It gives a mileage of 14.25kmpl in the city and 17.32kmpl on the highways.The remaining two variants, called 35 TDI Quattro Premium and 35 TDI Quattro Premium Plus, get a differently tuned engine that gives 174.33bhp at 4200rpm and 380Nm of torque at 1750-2500rpm. This is mated to a 7 speed S tronic gearbox. It gives a mileage of 12.0kmpl in the city and 15.73kmpl on the highways. As the names indicate, both these variants have an All-Wheel Drive whereas the S edition is in Front-Wheel Drive configuration.Both these engines beat the power output of the Diesel variant of the GLA, but pale in front of the 190bhp output churned out by the X1. The X1 is also mated to the tried and tested ZF automatic 8 speed gearbox, which is usually considered a more exciting proposition from a driver\xe2\x80\x99s perspective. The Q3\xe2\x80\x99s engine however is considered to be most refined and when the engine-transmission package is considered as a whole the Q3 consistently emerges as the better car among the three.RIDE AND HANDLING:The suspension system consist of a McPherson spring strut type axle at front with lower wishbones and with 4-link rear axle with separate spring/damper arrangement. It has anti-roll bars both at the front and back. The ride is quite good at low and medium speeds and even on the highway. The different drive modes on offer are not that noticeably different for the average driver. The ride overall however, is quite comfortable. Unless the bumps are too large, they are hardly noticeable. The steering does not give the greatest feedback, but does well in terms of overall precision. The vehicle does not give the \xe2\x80\x98sporty\xe2\x80\x99 response that one might get from the X1, but it does feel well planted. The All-Wheel variants have the signature Quattro drivetrain that does help with the acceleration available on tap. There might be some body roll due to it being quite tall. When you factor in the presence of the paddle shifts and AWD, it should make attacking some corners a little exciting although that is not what might have been on top priority for this vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s engineering team.The disc brakes are ventilated at the front and solid at the rear, and both are 16\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 in diameter. It does have Hydraulic Brake Assist, EBD and ABS as standard over all variants, which is quite obvious.SAFETY:In terms of safety, Audi has a track record of consistently achieving 5-star rating in NCAP test of its vehicles. So, it is a given that the passengers of the vehicle are quite safe (unless they are sticking out of the sunroof mentioned earlier.) There are no side airbags at the rear but there are a host of safety systems installed in the car which include ABS, Xenon Headlamps, EBD, Anti-theft alarm, Child safety locks and so on. Even the wheels on the car are fitted with Anti-theft bolts that can be unlocked only by the adapters that Audi provides. So, it takes care of both the passengers AND itself. If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spell safety, what does?VARIANTS:The SUV, as mentioned earlier, is offered in 3 variants and all of them run on diesel. The main difference between the variants will be the Drivetrain and the Engine output.The base S Edition variant is a FWD and misses out on Automatic Climate Control, and the automatic gearbox offered on higher variants. Considering the fact that both the X1 and the GLA get an automatic gearbox with and AWD drivetrain in the base variants, the Q3 does not make for a very convincing choice.The Premium and Premium Plus variants get AWD with the Quattro drivetrain and an automatic gearbox. Paddles are mounted on the steering for both variants, and this is one of the most significant additions to the new model. Other knick knacks like the Navigation system, Rear camera and an extra SD card slot are available only on the top variant. The lack of a navigation system in the mid-level variant is the only concrete reason to go for the top-level version. The other add-ons do not justify the price gap very much.VERDICT:The Audi Q3 was already very successful in its segment and gets a much needed boost to keep things that way. The diesel engine has lingered around for a while, but there is not exactly anything wrong with it to warrant a replacement. The design touches make it subtler and mature. If you are someone who is chauffeur-driven and wants one of the best all-rounder entry level SUVs in the luxury segment, this car is for you! You can take it out for a fun spin on the weekends too!\n \n \n \n '

sS'Bentley Continental'
p325
S"Bentley, a name that has towered above us all, has taken the range of automobiles to new bounds. It has presented its admirers with a fleet of cars that personify elegance and beauty, smashed together with the finest performance possible. Standing tall across the span of nearly a hundred years, this is a giant in the world of cars, a name that has been engraved in history to stand not only for the length of time that it exists, but well beyond. The standard that the company has set, along with the quality of design it invokes, is stoked to all new lengths with a brand new speculated machine that it is set to release. They call it the Bentayga.\n\nThis is a machine that is something no fan of this company has seen before. It is an ultra luxury crossover, an SUV that is a one of a kind for this company. The car stands tall and wide, with a robust, hefty build that invokes the menace of many other mighty giants such as Hummer. It is known that Bentley has invested a great amount of time, money and personnel on the working of this brand new masterpiece, which is sure to leave its thumb-print in the realm of SUVs and luxury crossovers. As far as the images on the interweb confirm, the machine is up-to-date on all fundamental and conventional features that Bentley's cars have sought to bring. It has been manufactured on a rat-race with sizzling competition with numerous other towering brands and companies. The Rolls Royce is also planning to bring out its very first SUV, and Bentley has beaten the odds to get there first. The Bentayga is a marvel from this manufacturer, a blend of good looks, elegance and class, but at the same time, nothing left compromised with performance and other heavier features.\n\nIt is seen with an architectural layout that gathers the most immense appeal. It is equipped with the same well bound body format that most top end SUV brands give their vehicles. The exterior structure of the vehicle is very much similar to the build of other machines of this segment such as the Hummer range. It is tall and lanky, with a robust body format to weather rougher terrain. It is speculated that the basis of this car would be harsher and more unpredictable off-the-road conditions, which is the reason behind its broad and well structured build. The side profile is accentuated with large fenders and broad wheels that are sure to grip the sand dunes when treading on them. The front is adorned with the conventional Bentley grille, complete with Continental style quad circular headlamps. The broad and rectangular headlamps are aided with the presence of smaller lights below it, and air vents positioned in between the entire frontage for maximum cooling to the large engine. The front bumper is large and wide, blending into the windscreen flawlessly. The rear end is wide and clean cut in its shape, with a headlamp cluster on either side of the trunk door. The lights are sure to be integrated with all the necessary brands of lighting, including LEDs, turn indicators and courtesy lights.\n\nWhen talking about the inside of the vehicle, it is an unspoken agreement to be noted, that this is manufacturer that leaves no stone unturned, when chasing grandeur in a vehicle's build. Bentley's models have always scathed the surface of the sky in terms of the luxury and the comfort that their vehicles bring to their passengers, and this model is surely no different. The inside of the vehicle is meant to be coated in the finest assortment of materials, handpicked and with the most profane choice selections. The refined materials that Bentley cars offer to their cabin's structure vary from metallic accents to wooden frames. The seats are covered in top grade, full premium leather, and the dashboard is structured boldly at the center of the entire desk. It is not doubted that the instrument cluster that the luxury brand gifts with this vehicle goes to new lengths, with the first of a kind model sure to set the best path possible. A high end stereo system is a sure addition to the ride quality, fulfilled on all regards. Radio function is a must for anyone riding a car these days, and Bentley's models take that necessity to all new fronts. USB connections are granted with all the vehicles that other brands make, and Bentley has never left this feature out with any of its vehicles. In addition to fulfilled gadgetry and high class upholstery, the vehicle must have the finest atmosphere, and this is enabled with a top grade air conditioning with ducts positioned all over for strategic circulation.\n\nAll brought together, the strong external cover and the blessed internal design together bring this vehicle to the edge that Bentley has always pushed towards. It is difficult to turn to the louder aspect that the vehicle commands, for rumor has it that this machine is based on the finest engineering and pioneering. Performance is captured within the halls of Bentley's designers, with all of its luxuriously built models all fetching fury of the highest, when entering the road. As a result, this uber-luxury crossover has a milestone to set in terms of speed for the SUV segment. According to what sources whisper, astonishing details are unveiling before us for this car and its performance. It is supposedly to be fired by an engine that dazzles with power like very few others have. A high powered 6.0-litre W12 engine is said to be hosting the speed requirements of the car, and this is by no means an ordinary drivetrain. Although it is not confirmed, these are speculative adjustments, and another one is nothing close to awesome as well. A 4.0-litre twin turbo V8 engine is another choice of engine that it seems the car will have, and both of these engines together meant to leave the roads trembling wherever this machine passes. It is rumored that this will be build on a chassis system based on that of the Audi Q5, and this is probably one of the best qualities one could expect of it, in terms of performance and control. It is built on a technology that guarantees a mix of both on-road and off-the-road performance. The machine ensures that the needs of the road are geared up for, with techno systems to enhance ride pleasure and safety, like all of Bentley's extraordinary machines have.\n\nFurthermore, the Bentayga is sure to be armed with the gift of precision with technology as well, with all the technologically advanced features that vehicles of this company have had, from ABS and EBD to airbags and other stuff. This machine is a one of a kind innovation, something that is sure to raise Bentley and its manufacturing base to a whole new grounding in the industry. It is known beyond doubt that the range of vehicles commanded by this awe-inciting manufacturer reach new peaks with every new release, and here is a release that is to set the bars up all over again. The Bentley Bentayga is all set to unleash itself in 2016, and while it does, the world sits awaiting its launch. "

sS'Hyundai EON'
p327
S"IntroductionWhen Hyundai Eon was launched, it made almost all the heads turn thanks to its attractive design, which was non-existent in its segment. Yes, the Maruti Alto 800 may be the best selling car in the country, but we all would agree it\xe2\x80\x99s not particularly expressive. So, when Hyundai launched Eon, the vibes were so strong that the Maruti launched a special edition variant of the then Alto just a day before the Eon launch. Hyundai Eon has the big responsibility to follow the footsteps of the iconic Santro that put the Korean car company on the right track.Pros1. Looks fantastic, especially considering its segment. The styling does not seem aged, even 5 years after its launch.2. One of the best car in its segment in terms of build quality. Is miles ahead of the the Alto.3. The interiors have a premium feel with good quality of materials and high levels of fit & finish.Cons1. Steering does not weigh up well at highway speeds, failing to instill confidence in the driver.2. The Noise & Vibration levels are high, characteristic of 3-cylinder engines.Stand-out features1. First-in-segment features like Tilt Steering & Driver Side Airbag2. Available in 0.8l & 1.0l engine variants.ExteriorHyundai Eon is the smallest car to get the company\xe2\x80\x99s fluidic design and the design philosophy shines the best through the car. Eon could be the car with most curves and lines in its segment, or a segment higher for that matter.Heads-on, the Hyundai Eon gets swept back headlamps with a neat chrome strip adorning the Hyundai logo. The hexagonal grille is also a part of the front bumper which is really big and gives a macho look to the front of the Eon.Sculpted bonnet and neatly designed fog lamps are a rarity for the cars in this segment.Come to the side and see the fluidic design flow through the car with beefed up wheel arches, a shoulder line that runs from the headlamps to the tail. Another sculpted line runs the length of the car between the front and rear wheels.The shoulder line scoop upward towards the rear that makes the side profile sportier but rear window visibility is compromised. Even the door handles follow the shoulder line\xe2\x80\x99s path with the rear door handles positioned slightly higher than the front ones.To the rear, the large tail lamps are well designed, following the car\xe2\x80\x99s extroversive character. The rear glass is pretty wide and the rear spoiler is neatly integrated.The rear bumper is pretty meaty but is a size bigger than necessary, also making the boot less accessible by that much. The exhaust pipe is neatly hidden  underneath the rear bumper, allowing for a neat layout.The Eon gets 145mm tyres with 12 inch rims for the D-Lite, D-Lite+, and ERA+ variants and 155mm tyres with larger 13 inch rims on Magna+ and Sportz variants. Both are pretty skinny and we recommend an upgrade to 165 or wider tyres for safety.InteriorsGet inside and you will be greeted by one of the best designed interiors with the quality of the fit and finish matching it. The Eon gets the segment\xe2\x80\x99s best looking dashboard (equalled by the recently launched Renault Kwid maybe) and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to believe in this segment. Hyundai has upheld its reputation of putting the best looking interiors with amazing build quality.The interiors get a black and beige layout. The dashboard is spread like the wings of a bird with a V shaped centre console.The instrument cluster features a large circular pod that houses the speedometer and a MID at the bottom, displaying the odometer, trip meter and shift indicator. There are two small circular pods on either side showing the fuel level and engine temperature gauges. Overall, the meters are easily readable and are designed neatly. The lack of a tachometer is easily felt and there is no option for the same even in the top variants.The steering wheel is nicely designed with a V-shaped silver highlight in the middle and is of a good size, if not a tad bigger. The steering wheel also gets a first-in-segment tilt adjustment.The centre console houses the middle AC vents and a 2-DIN audio system and air conditioning controls below. The switches and knobs are of good size and quality.The glove box is wide and deep, offering lots of space for your needs. Other storage spaces come in the form of a storage spot on the top of the dashboard, bottle holders on the front doors, door pockets and cup holders in the middle.Both the front and rear seats offer amazing under thigh support especially in this segment. The front seats get integrated headrests that are positioned very efficiently and the cushioning is also good. At the rear, the space available is one of the best in the segment (not surprising considering that the Eon gets the same wheelbase as the Santro and i10).215 litres of boot space means you can travel with your luggage neatly tucked in the rear. The boot space is one of the biggest in the segment miles ahead of the Alto\xe2\x80\x99s 177 liters and Nanos abysmal 80 liters. Only the newly released Renault Kwid beats the Eon as its boot space stands at 300 liters. PerformanceThe Hyundai Eon is now available in two petrol engine options - 0.8L iRDE engine and 1.0L Kappa engine.Eon 0.8L iRDEThe Hyundai Eon 0.8L iRDE is powered by a 814 cc, 3-cylinder petrol engine that puts out 55 bhp of maximum power at 5500 rpm and 76 Nm of maximum torque at 4000 rpm. It is the same unit that powers the i10 in a downsized form with a cylinder chopped off, mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox. The engine is nicely refined but still you can feel the engine upon starting it through the gear lever.The engine is designed to offer maximum fuel economy, so don\xe2\x80\x99t expect outright performance. The 3-cylinder unit is best suited for city driving. The throttle response and low end power delivery is not bad. The engine responds nicely to short bursts of acceleration and can cruise in the highways around 120 km/h without any hassle. But be it the traffic laden city roads or the highways, the gearbox demands a healthy workout from you to extract the performance you expect.The clutch is one of the lightest that you can experience and mix that to the light steering and the city driving will be effortless. The steering is a tad too light to our liking and this proves to be a problem on the highways when you are cruising in triple digit speeds. The lack of feedback from the steering can be frightening at high speeds around the curves.\n  Eon 1.0L KappaHyundai also added the 1.0-litre Kappa engine to the Eon range to compete better with the Alto, which is available with a 0.8-litre and a 1.0-litre engine option. The Eon 1.0-litre Kappa is powered by a 998 cc, 3-cylinder petrol engine that makes 68 bhp at 6200 rpm and a peak torque of 94 Nm at 3500 rpm.Mated to a 5-speed manual gearbox, the Eon 1.0L is for those who think that the 0.8L Eon is a bit slow. Though not by a large margin, the 1.0-L does offer a bit more zippy engine and Hyundai has also taken care of the jerkiness that you experience with the smaller engine.\nThere are no other changes mechanically and the Eon 1.0L behaves the same like the 0.8L but with a bit more briskness. The Eon 1.0L is only available in Magna+ (O) variant.Ride and HandlingAs far as the ride quality and handling characteristics are concerned, both the 0.8L and 1.0L behave similarly as there are no differences in the suspension setup. The Hyundai Eon gets the typical McPherson strut to the front and torsion beam axle to the rear for the suspension duties. While the Eon goes smooth as long as the roads are smooth and can absorb slight aberrations of without a problem. But as the going gets tough, the Eon does get going but you will feel each and every bit of those large bumps.When it comes to handling, predictable is the word that describes that of the Eon. Hyundai Eon doe a neat job of going around the city traffic without any drama. Over the highways, while the straight line stability is good, going around the curves will rob you off the confidence. The skinny tyres are the major reason and hence we recommend wider tyre upgrade at the earliest. The tyres take no time to understeer if pushed hard and the body roll also crops in.While the light steering is good for the city commutes, the feedback from it is almost nonexistent on the highways. The brakes though have a nice bite to them and inspire confidence during high speed braking situations.SafetyThe safety features of the Hyundai Eon include reinforced body structure, front and rear seat belts, child safety rear door locks, engine immobilizer, front fog lamps and driver airbag in one variant (Sportz).\n VariantsHyundai Eon is available in six variants - five for the 0.8L version D-Lite, D-Lite+, Era+, Magna+ and Sprotz; and one Magna+ (O) for the 1.0-L version.The D-Lite variant is the most basic variant with front and rear seat belts, engine immobilizer, integrated spoiler, bench folding rear seat, dual trip meter, remote fuel lid opener and tailgate release.With D-Lite+, you get front speaker grille and the much needed air conditioner and power steering.The Era+ variant offers you the option for choosing a LPG fuel source apart from tinted glass, body colour bumper, silver touch on center fascia, front door map with bottle holder, power outlet, front power windows and front door armrest.Our favorite pick of the lot is the Magna+which is offered with central locking, internally adjustable wing mirrors, passenger side win mirror, tilt steering, roof antenna, front and rear speaker grille, rear parcel tray and 2 DIN Radio+MP3 Audio.The top end Sportz gets you keyless entry, front fog lamps, driver airbag, body coloured ORVMs and door handles and metallic finish 3-Spoke steering wheel.The Magna+ (O) features that are a couple of segments above like keyless entry and also includes front fog lamps, body coloured wing mirrors and door handles.VerdictHyundai Eon brings to the table what the other cars have failed to at the same time inspired other companies (read Renault with their Kwid) to bring a great looking car that offers best-in-class build quality, good fuel economy and lots of features in this segment. In typical Hyundai way.The Eon is certainly eons ahead of what the Alto offers and is almost head on with the Renault Kwid. So close, that we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come to a conclusion between the two. The biggest advantage the Eon holds over the Kwid is that it's available without a waiting period, however the Kwid is more appealing as it is the new k(w)id on the block."

S'The Mercedes-Benz SLC is the successor to the SLK two-door. Revealed in 2015, the SLC is offered with a range of petrol and diesel engines, but Mercedes-Benz India will start right at the top, by launching the AMG SLC43. The roadster is the first AMG model to have the \xe2\x80\x9843\xe2\x80\x99 label in its name and while the design is essentially a facelift of the SLK, there\xe2\x80\x99s more than meets the eye.The primary change is the SLC\xe2\x80\x99s new engine. In keeping with the era of downsizing, the model gets a 3.0-litre twin-turbo V6 that replaces the naturally aspirated V8 that was used in the SLK. The new motor produces 367PS of power and a peak torque of 520Nm, all of which, is sent to the rear wheels. 0-100kmph comes up in a claimed 4.7 seconds, with the top speed rated at 250kmph (electronically-limited). The SLC43 comes with a 9-speed automatic gearbox as standard and the transmission gets paddle shifters as well.For improved handling and stability, the SLC43 gets a steel suspension that has been optimised to reduce body roll and you also get the AMG \xe2\x80\x98Dynamic Select\xe2\x80\x99 function, which enables the driver to alter the suspension\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, based on the driving scenario. Additionally, you can opt for a \xe2\x80\x98handling package\xe2\x80\x99, which gives you a mechanical limited-slip differential for the rear axle.The SLC43 is a thing of beauty with the compact proportions complementing the car\xe2\x80\x99s understated styling. Highlights on the exterior include a new front bumper with large air intakes, a muscular bonnet, 18-inch alloy wheels and a new rear bumper with integrated tailpipes.On the inside, the car features a multifunction, flat-bottomed steering wheel draped in nappa leather, with red contrast stitching for a premium ambience.

It is also the first SUV developed by BMW and was made available with an all-wheel drive mechanism. Its second generation model was introduced in the year 2006, but was kept away from India. This model was launched in India for the first time in the year 2014. Ever since, it received no major changes, except for some minor tweaks and updates.Overview:X5 has always been the front runner for BMW's SUV fleet. Despite heavy competition from the likes of Audi and Mercedes, it managed to break into the luxury SUV segment of India. Now, in its third generation, this mid-size luxury SUV is performing well with respect to sales in the country. Just a few months ago, a new variant has been added to this series code named M Sport, which happened to be a CBU. Now, the manufacturer has started to assemble it locally in India, helping it to be more competitive with respect to price range.Exteriors:The exterior design of this machine has been improved drastically over the years. Although, its shares the same design traits like its predecessor, it looks much more bolder and refreshing. This third generation model was introduced in 2013 and is yet to recieve a major cosmetic update. Its exterior design inherits the BMW design DNA, whcih makes it look more of a crossover from the frontage.The headlight cluster on the front facade has a sharper design and is packed with adaptive LED headlights and LED DRLs. In the center, the kidney bean shaped radiator grille looks perfect in side and comes with vertical slats. They are garnished in chrome for a classy appeal.The front bumper looks smaller in size, but has enough muscle to render a dynamic appeal to the frontage. The fog lamps have been positioned right below the headlamps that adds to its distinct appeal. The M Sport version on the other hand gets a different bumper featuring bigger air vents.The side profile of the SUV exudes the sense of magnificence with its expressive crease lines and chrome inserts. Besides, its large fenders featuring alloy wheels renders it a bold and dynamic look.The high end version in this series gets a set of 19 inch M light alloy wheels of double spoke design that brings the aura of a true SUV.

Its bold taillight cluster with signature lighting pattern brings the grace to this facet. It houses LED brake lights and turn blinkers and courtesy lights as well. Unlike the front bumper, the rear one looks bigger in size and it features two exhaust pipes along with reflectors for additional safety.This SUV from BMW measures about 4886mm in length, 1762mm in overall height and 1938mm in total width. It also has a cargo volume of 650-litres.Interiors:The interiors of the vehicle are equally impressive as its exteriors. Soon after entering the cabin, you'll notice the use of premium grade materials with high quality fit and finish. A lavish and rich cabin is importance for any high-end luxury car and X5 delivers it quite well in this regard. This typical BMW SUV comes with seven seater capacity with better leg and shoulder room inside.Its dashboard comes with a dual tone finish with Fine-wood trim Fine line textured finish that adds to the sophistication of the insides. Besides, there is an extensive use of high gloss black and metallic inserts that further compliments its exclusivity.The steering wheel has a conventional three spoke design mounted with multi-functional switches and BMW logo. This steering wheel feels nice and premium in hand, thanks to its leather covering.The center fascia of dashboard is mounted with an advanced infotainment system featuring 26cm color display. It also has a DVD player and an integrated hard-drive for maps and audio files. This system also features navigation that always helps you in choosing right direction.Floor console in the cockpit houses an array of control switches, which are well within the reach of the driver. The gearshift selector with illumination is the highlight of the interiors. The floor console has a perfect finish and the veneers on it adds to the grace.The second row seats are in bench format that can accommodate three passengers. However, the third row can house only two passengers. Like mentioned above, it is more suitable for children.Its front seats on the other hand are far more comfortable thanks to their ergonomic design. They are designed with side bolsters and support that aids in providing unparalleled comfort to the occupants.Despite of certain shortcomings, this BMW X5 lives upto the expectations of customers, especially with regards to the comfort and lavishness. However, on the design front, it needs some more upgrades to match its rivals.Performance :Diesel :This stunning machine gets a 3.0-litre diesel engine that is powerful, efficient and has displacement capacity of 2993cc. This TwinPower turbo motor comes with state-of-the-art fuel injection technologies that aids in improved fuel economy. On the highways, it gives you approximately 15.97 Kmpl, which is quite good compared to what its rivals offer. This six cylinder motor can produce a maximum power of 258bhp at 4000rpm and delivers torque output of 560Nm ranging between 1500 to 3000rpm. In a mere 6.9 seconds, the machine crosses the 100 Kmph speed mark, while achieving an impressive top speed of 230 Kmph. Mated to this mill is an 8-speed Steptronic Sport automatic transmission gear box that transmits power to all its wheels.Ride and HandlingThis huge machine runs smooth and remains stable no matter on which terrain you drive it. The adaptive suspension package 'Comfort' ensures high level of comfort irrespective of the road conditions. Also, with the BMW Driving Experience Control, you will get extra options of Sport and Sport+ modes to select from. Meanwhile, the xDrive30d M Sport variant is incorporated with the adaptive M suspension system that also guarantees excellent ride quality. On the other hand, it gets a servotronic steering assist column that aids in better handling. Not only it adjusts to match with the vehicle's speed but also minimizes the effort you usually put in, to turn this wheel.SafetyThe company has not compromised in matters related to safety as this machine comes loaded with an array of elements that increases the level of security. Around six airbags are on the offer to prevent possible injury caused due to an impact, while all the occupants get three point seat belts with front pyrotechnic belt tensioners and force limiters. Electronic immobilizer safeguards the vehicle from theft, whereas the advanced ABS, cornering brake control as well as dynamic stability control are helpful in boosting the braking performance besides keeping the machine in good control. Other attributes such as the BMW Condition Based Service, ISOFIX child seat mounting and run flat indicator also aid for a safer journey.VariantsHere, the Expedition variant is offered with an array of interesting features like the BMW Driving Experience Control, multifunction sport leather steering wheel, Hi-Fi loudspeaker system, 8-speed steptronic automatic transmission and many more.The xDrive 30d Design Pure Experience trim, which is a five seater, gets a few extra elements such as an 8-speed steptronic sport automatic transmission, BMW Apps, Harman Kardon Surround system, and adaptive LED headlights with auto high beam assistance to name a few.In the 7-seater range, you will get the foldable third row seats to make additional room for luggage, while it also has heating/ventilation console with cup holders as an added benefit.Meanwhile, the top spec M Sport model includes BMW head-up display, Adaptive M suspension system, 19-inch double spoke style M light alloy wheels as well as M Sport Package, which altogether makes it the most expensive variant in the entire lineup.Verdict:The third generation BMW X5 has undergone changes over the year, but the handling still feels like what it was back in 1999. This SUV offers exceptional driving dynamics and sheer balance, which only a few SUVs of this size can offer. The 3.0-litre twin-power turbo diesel engine under the hood is punchy and powerful enough to surprise you. Adding to this, its smooth 8-speed automatic gearbox makes driving even exciting. This BMW has everything that a high-end luxury SUV should have. But on the design front, its interiors needs a bit of work. Also, it could use some tweaks to the exterior design like we've seen in 3-Series sedan and X3 SUV. Another big drawback is that the rear cabin is not comfortable for adults. "

sS'Maruti Swift'
p333
S"Introduction:Maruti Suzuki has long occupied the top spot in the Indian auto space. Cars such as the Alto 800 and the Alto K10 captured the needs of the Indian masses. The Swift goes to show how the company excels in its understanding of the Indian market. This is a vehicle that has hit the right note with the Indian audiences, offering the right balance between quality and price. Released a few years ago, it has performed better in the market than most people back then would have foreseen, and we're here to examine all we can get about the vehicle to find out why.Pros:1. Its cost of ownership is reasonable. 2. Interior environment goes well with the masses. Cons:1. The legroom for the second row could be improved.2. Its engine specs are inferior to class rivals.Stand-Out Features:1. The stereo system that comes along with radio and CD charger is a great ride bonus.Overall:The Swift is offered in four variants, of both petrol and diesel trims. For the petrol version is a K-Series petrol engine, while on the diesel front is a 1248cc DDiS motor. Most people would find the interiors to be just what's needed, with some mediocre style that isn't overdone. Comfort is solidified with many functions ranging from adjustable seats, an accessory socket, power windows, Bluetooth system and many more. When you take stock of the vehicle and its reception, one can't help but think that this is just the type of model needed to pacify the Indian auto-stock every few years.Exteriors:The vehicle has been crafted with a sporty demeanour, and we thought that the company had given it just the tone that audiences today love. Nevertheless, one can spot influences of other models on this one, and this does bring a more favourable aura.The large black grille at the front animates the face, with the Suzuki emblem at the focus of the face. On either side, the headlamp clusters stream upwards in a wave like design, and we thought they brought a more unique theme to the front profile.The large air dam at the bottom of the face invites a more well-integrated image at the front, with fog lamps by the corner. The hood drapes down towards the front skirts, clean and wide without design lines.Meanwhile, the side is given its prominence with the gentle fenders, and the body coloured door handles and mirrors. The well crafted steel wheels do stir some fervour in the look, along with the gentle wheel arches around them. The black highlight on the window frames are also good.The side profile comes without the character lines that are often present in cars these days, and we appreciated the distinctive look this gave to the machine.The rear portion has been given more muscle, and this renders a more balanced look for the model. The tail-lamps at the rear slide outwards towards into the side, and the intricate designing on them improves the look.Fine body cladding runs over the the rear, while the massive bumpers at the rear add a more bold effect to the overall design.Interiors:We thought that the interiors were done up well, although some might feel that the space could have been improved. The front bench offers plenty of legroom, but taller members of our team felt slightly congested at the rear. Nevertheless, there is ample space for your head and shoulders in here.The heavy black interiors might not go well with some, but we personally felt it was great. At the front, the large dashboard stretches over the front, with the glovebox area drooping down towards the passengers' legs.The centre console hosts a stereo unit that comes with a small display screen, and buttons by the side. Controls to the air conditioning system have been poised below this.A small storage unit is present on the floor console, so that the driver and the co passenger can reach for it without hassle. We thought that the 3-spoke steering wheel was good to hold, and easy to operate with. The Suzuki emblem rests at the centre of the wheel, and contrasting silver highlights also hone the look.Positioned within the line of sight of the driver ahead of the wheel is the instrument cluster that hosts a tachometer and a speedometer, both of which come with apt illumination.The seats have been given a good ergonomic structure, and you're sure to face little strain during the ride. Headrests further boost safety and comfort for the occupants. The upholstery is decent, but the lack of leather might lower the standard for some.Performance:Diesel:For diesel versions, there is a DDiS engine that displaces 1248cc. The mill consists of 4 cylinders and 16 valves incorporated together. The company has also armed the motor with a fixed geometry turbocharger that comes along with an intercooler. Fuel delivery takes place through a common rail direct injection. We thought that the specs were decent for its class, with a power of 74bhp at 4000rpm, along with a torque of 190Nm at 2000rpm. The engine's prowess is channelled through a 5-speed manual gearbox. The engine noise is kept well tamed at all speeds, so that highway cruises are also a noise free, peaceful affair. The throttle response is great, and the gear shifting makes the experience even smoother. Petrol:For the petrol side, there is a K-series motor that comes along with the VVT system. It displaces 1197cc, and gives 83.11bhp of power at 6000rpm, and 115Nm of torque at 4000rpm. It has a naturally aspirated air changing system, while a multipoint fuel injection system ensures smooth fuel delivery. The engine has been coupled to the same 5-speed manual gearbox as the diesel variant. The cruising capacity is solid, while the clutch and the gear shifter lighten the driver\xe2\x80\x99s load. You\xe2\x80\x99d have an easy time reaching speeds of nearly 150kmph, and this is more than we\xe2\x80\x99d usually ask for petrol. This engine thrusts the car to high speeds easier and quicker than the diesel variant, but high speeds might make the driver jittery with this mill. Ride and Handling:A combination of ventilated discs and drums fortify the vehicle's braking mechanism. Meanwhile, a McPherson strut has been rigged onto the front axle, with a torsion beam at the rear. We thought that the overall ride was comfortable enough, and irregularities on the road are handled well by the vehicle. Cornering and turning were also a pleasant affair, although high speeds increase hassle during the same. The electronic power steering makes the experience even better, and you're sure to take note of the quick steering response.Safety:The safety facet was at par with segment rivals, but we thought the presence of ABS and EBD was a bonus. Reverse parking sensors, airbags for the front occupants, a brake assist feature, 3-point ELR front seatbelts and a security alarm system ensure peace of mind for the passengers. Also present is a dual horn, a high mounted stop lamp, side door impact beams, head restraints and many more features.Variants:The model series has four variants, LXi LXi(O), VXi and ZDi. The base variant, LXi comes with some basic features, and most people might not find this appeasing. Body coloured bumpers, front 2-speed intermittent wipers, an instrument cluster, a light off reminder buzzer, a low fuel warning lamp, a digital clock and many more nominal facilities bring some comfort home with this variant. The LXi(O) has the same list as the first. Next, the VXi spruces the experience up a little, with a stereo unit that comes with CD player and radio, intelligent speed based audio volume feature, Aux-In and USB facilities, front fog lamps, and OVRMs with turn indicators. The top end trim, ZDi come with a sprawling list that includes a map lamp, Bluetooth and Audio switches in the steering wheel, a front seat belt adjuster, rear window defogger, rear washer and wiper, and an electromagnetic back door opener. We'd recommend the base variants if you're not looking for too much jazz within the vehicle, and would prefer a cheaper price tag. For people who insist on comfort and entertainment, we'd say the top end trims would suit you better. Meanwhile, for those of you looking for something in between, there's always the mid range trims.VerdictThe swift is just the type of car that people of this country would love. It delivers a good ride experience without eating up too much cash, and it comes with some strong western influences for the new generation. On the downside, however, the vehicle's engine specs might let some down, while its considerable lack of lavishness sets it behind other models. We'd tell you this, if you're looking for a car to get you from home to office and vice versa with some good comfort along the way, then you might find a good companion in this model. If you're the type that needs over-the-top luxury and comfort, and can afford it, another model would suit you best."
