S'Maruti Wagon R'
p1
S'The WagonR was amongst the first cars in the world to follow a \xe2\x80\x98tall-boy\xe2\x80\x99 design language. The short nose and nearly upright proportions helped it stand out amongst a sea of tiny hatchbacks. The domestic market originally shrugged the WagonR off for it\xe2\x80\x99s boxy proportions. However, over the years, the WagonR has developed quite a niche for itself. In its 3rd iteration, the WagonR continues to be a cash cow for Maruti, raking in consistent sales, month after month. What does the WagonR do to register such high sales? Let\xe2\x80\x99s find out!Space. A spacious hatchback in the truest sense of the word.Peppy petrol engine. Just the right amount of power for the city.Optional Airbags and ABS across all trims.Optional AMT ups the convenience quotient in an already easy to drive car.Quality of materials used in the interior could\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99ve been better. Feels low rent.NVH levels aren\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\xc2\x99t the best. Lot of engine noise filters into the cabin.Brakes feel spongy. Could have done with better pedal response.No diesel motor. Tata Tiago gets a diesel engine in the same price range.Optional AMT, makes city commutes even easier.Safety tech viz. airbags and ABS optional from base spec.The Wagon R might not be the best looking or have all the bells and whistles, but it is a practical hatch in every sense of the word. It is spacious, fuel efficient and has Maruti Suzuki\xe2\x80\x99s dependable after sales network to back it up."The WagonR gives importance to practicality over style, function over form."If you are the practical kind and want sheer utility from your next hatchback, the WagonR fits the bill nicely. The WagonR dates back to as far as 1999 when it first debuted in the Indian market. It sported a peppy 1.0-litre motor, that went on to power other hatchbacks (like the Estilo) in the Maruti portfolio. Maruti updated the looks on a timely basis to make the WagonR keep up with the times. A mildly refreshed version hit showroom floors in 2006. The hatchback entered it\xe2\x80\x99s third innings in the A1 hatchback segment in 2010, post which, it hasn\'t received any major cosmetic update. Recent updates to the WagonR include slightly reworked grille and bumpers, optional ABS & airbags across all trims and an optional AMT.'

sS'Datsun Redi GO'
p3
S'A small, compact car makes a lot of sense for the crowded by-lanes our country springs up every now and then. Japanese automaker Nissan resurrected the Datsun brand and gave us the GO hatchback and the GO+ MPV. Sadly, neither of them have managed to get in the numbers the manufacturer was hoping. Say hello to the Datsun redi-GO; a tiny hatchback for the big city, that has been launched at an attractive Rs 2.39 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) for the base \'D\' variant. In all, the redi-GO is available in five variants \xe2\x80\x93 D, A, T, T (O), and S. Let\'s see what\'s on offerClaimed efficiency is 25.17kmpl. Identical to its sibling, the Renault Kwid.Super-light steering wheel makes it easy to drive in tight, urban spaces.Compact proportions. Fits in practically anywhere.Airbag limited to top-spec version only. No ABS at all.No touchscreen infotainment, digital instrument cluster like the Kwid.Quality and fit and finish levels are average.Cool looking LED daytime running lamps are unique to the redi-GO.Ground clearance is a class leading 185 mm. (Kwid = 180mm)The person who buys the Datsun redi-GO will most probably be the first-time buyer who is upgrading from a scooter or a motorbike. He or she will also probably be a novice driver which means that the redi-GO would make a great car to learn or improve one\xe2\x80\x99s driving skills on. But the redi-GO is not for the kind of customer who wants something exciting to drive and something that has good road dynamics. A 1-litre engine variant is expected to join the ranks but that will probably hit showrooms sometime later this or year or in 2017. "The redi-Go is a smart, stylish, practical & value for money city run about. "Overall, the redi-GO looks quite funky, has a lot of space and offers a good ride quality. Essentially, if you are the kind of person that is looking for a point A to point B travel in a car that is easy to drive in traffic and easy to park, the redi-GO will suit you well. '

sS'Mahindra TUV 300'

S"Mahindra is identified as one of India\xe2\x80\x99s favourite utility vehicle makers. The brand also took the first stab at the sub-4 metre SUV space by chopping the Xylo to create the Quanto. However, the Quanto couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the response Mahindra was hoping for, which took the Indian automaker back to the drawing board.After spending years in development, Mahindra introduced the TUV3OO in order to reinforce its position as the country\xe2\x80\x99s favourite SUV maker. We've got to say, the vehicle does make a pretty amazing impression and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to discover, but first, let\xe2\x80\x99s weigh the pros and cons.At 384 litres, it has segment leading cargo volume.Cabin space. Generous amount of legroom and headroom in the first two rows.Dual airbags along with ABS and EBD available across trim levels.The third row jump-seats aren\xc3\x83\xc2\xa2\xc3\x82\xc2\x80\xc3\x82\xc2\x99t very comfortable. Best suited to small adults or children.1.5-litre engine lacks refinement. Sounds crude, also runs out of breath at highway speeds.NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) levels aren\xc3\x83\xc2\xa2\xc3\x82\xc2\x80\xc3\x82\xc2\x99t the best. Lot of vibrations can be felt through the pedals and gear lever.MicroHybrid tech is a segment first. Helps improve efficiency.BlueSense technology on the integrated music system. Essentially converts the phone into a BT remote for the system.We'll put it this way - if you need a roomy compact SUV for 5 people and their luggage, the TUV300 is a great option. It has a few chinks in its armor with a slightly low-rent build quality and a mediocre engine compared to its arch rival - the Ford Ecosport. However, in offers the most space in the segment, has an imposing design that no rival can match and can take on bad roads so well, you wish it came with 4x4.  "

sS'Honda BRV'
p7
S'The compact SUV segment has been buzzing of late, with a plethora of launches and updates flooding the market. The segment that was kickstarted by the Renault Duster now has an entrant from the Land of the Rising Sun. Honda has jumped into the fray with the BR-V, a seven-seater crossover SUV. The Hyundai Creta and the Renault Duster lie squarely in its crosshairs.What does it offer? Let\'s take a look! Leather upholstery on the top-spec variant adds a premium touch to the cabin.An extra row of seats. Can accommodate the in-laws for the occasional weekend trip.Petrol motor is very refined. Optional CVT automatic available as well.The diesel engine is amongst the most fuel-efficient engines of the lot. The ARAI-rated mileage stands at 21.9km/l.No diesel automatic variant on offer. The Creta and the Duster offer the same.Build quality isn\'t the best. Sheet metal seems thin and the quality of interior plastics is a let-down as well.Woefully under-equipped vis-a-vis rivals such as the Creta and the Duster. No touchscreen audio system, reverse camera or parking sensors.210mm of ground clearance is on par with segment best Renault Duster AWD.Paddle shifters on the petrol automatic are exclusive to the BR-V.Roof mounted AC vents for the 2nd row ensure good flow to the 3rd row as well.With the BR-V, Honda has done just about enough to keep up with the competition, but little to beat it. It has seven seats, offers a compliant ride, and has engines that have proven themselves in other cars from the Japanese automaker\xe2\x80\x99s stable. However, everything else is lukewarm at best, with nothing to make you exclaim in appreciation. In a market that has buyers who are hungry for features, loading the BR-V to the gills should have been a no-brainer. Hyundai did it with the Creta and the results are here for us to see."The only advantage the BR-V offers over its rivals is the 7 seats."The two deal makers for the BR-V will be the fact that it has seven seats and Honda\xe2\x80\x99s hassle-free ownership experience. Honda had an opportunity to more than one up the slow-selling Mobilio, but may have played it too safe in a highly-competitive market. Honda has priced the BR-V petrol between Rs. 8.75 \xe2\x80\x93 11.99 lakh and the diesel between Rs. 9.90 \xe2\x80\x93 12.90 lakh. This puts it around the same range as the Duster and Creta and will make it tempting for buyers with large families. We just wish it came with more kit to drive the deal home.The BR-V combines the design traits of a utilitarian MPV with the flamboyance of an SUV. The design can be a hit or a miss with varied audiences, but on the whole, it is pretty likeable. We like the looks of the BR-V from the front three-quarters. The angry, Accord inspired face looks nice. Elements such as the large projector headlamps with LED light guides, chunky chrome grille and the aggressive creases make it stand out. The side and the rear are relatively run of the mill. That said, we do like the funky 16-inch alloy wheels, the dab of chrome on the doors and the matte silver roof rails. From the side, the BR-V does resemble the Mobilio a fair bit, thanks to the kink in the window line. The rear is plain-jane, housing just the large connected tail lamps and a garnish of chrome above the numberplate area. Boot space is adequate at 223-litres with all three rows in place, and 691-litres with the last row tucked away. Lest we forget, the BR-V gets the mandatory matte-black cladding and silver faux skid plates as well. If you have been inside the new Honda Amaze, you have been inside the BR-V. The design is similar to the compact sedan, with the only difference being the all-black color scheme. The dashboard is a busy place, with lots of cuts and creases thrown in. The piano black finish on the centre console and the dull silver accents liven up the place a bit. The top-spec BR-V gets goodies such as leather upholstery, automatic climate control, rear air-conditioning, integrated music system with Bluetooth, and steering mounted controls. We have to say that the BR-V is sparsely equipped compared to its competition. It misses out on touchscreen infotainment, navigation, reverse camera to list a few. Legroom and headroom are generous in the BR-V. While Honda bills it as a seven-seater, we think it is best used to seat six. There just isn\'t enough shoulder room for three occupants in the second row. The S-Cross fares much better in this regard. The BR-V gets a heart transplant from the popular Honda City. It sports the same 1.5-litre i-VTEC and i-DTEC motors in a similar state of tune. The petrol motor now gets a new six-speed manual transmission, instead of the old five-speed unit and an optional CVT automatic as well. Unlike the Duster or the Creta, there\'s no diesel automatic BR-V \xe2\x80\x94 just a six-speed manual. 1.5-litre i-VTECThe petrol motor is amongst the most refined petrol engines in its class. The BR-V petrol picks up pace swiftly and can be a good city runabout. The clutch is light and the six-speed gearbox is a gem to use as well. The optional CVT makes light of city traffic, and is heavily recommended in case you spend most of your commute time stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. 1.5-litre i-DTECNoise levels are thankfully at acceptable levels here. It isn\'t as noisy as the Honda Amaze. There is considerable turbo-lag upto 1700rpm, post which the BR-V pulls clean. The lag can be an irritant in traffic and requires frequent downshifts to keep the engine in the powerband. Out on the highway, the BR-V is a relaxed cruiser that can clock triple digit speeds all day long. That said, how we wish there was a diesel automatic variant!Ride and Handling Ground Clearance is rated at 210mm, that is on par with the segment best (Duster AWD). You can take the BR-V over broken roads and undulations and it does take it in its stride rather well. The suspension is well-tuned for our roads and ride quality is appreciable at city speeds. For the highway runs, it is stiff enough to not induce vertical movements. Show the BR-V a set of twisties and it will surprise you. We have to say the steering is amongst the most neutral, well-behaved units out there. The weight, feel and feeback is just right that lets you know what the front wheels are upto! Of course, there is considerable amount of body roll thanks to the height of the car \xe2\x80\x94 but nothing that is off-putting. The BRV is at par with the competition in terms of safety. The BRV scored 5 stars in the Adult Occupant Protection (AOP) and 4 stars in the Child Occupant Protection (COP) tests conducted by the New Car Assessment Programme for Southeast Asian Countries (ASEAN NCAP). In terms of safety features, the car gets dual front airbags as standard while ABS is available in all the variants except the base trim.Other safety features that are spread across the variants include a driver seatbelt reminder, security alarm and impact sensing door unlock. Dual front airbags come as standard across the range which is a welcome addition and while ABS with EBD is offered as standard with the base diesel, the petrol only gets it in the S-variant. Our favourite is the mid spec S variant that gets the 2DIN entertainment system with multi-media support and steering mounted audio controls.You also get automatic climate control and chauffeur driven owners get a sliding 2nd row seat and rear AC vents. A height-adjustable seat for the driver, along with the rear defogger, wiper and washer are also offered, making this the most value for money variant in the range.  '

S'When we look at the record that Hyundai has made here in India, we tend to wonder just how the South Korean manufacturer overshot numerous local and international competitors to become the second largest carmaker in India. Well, when you look at a car like the Elite i20, you tend to get a glimpse of the answer. Style, comfort and performance come together in this vehicle, making it quite a likeable package. Ever since its introduction, the Elite i20 has found favour with Indian buyers. Newer rivals have entered the fray, making things all the more competitive, but Hyundai\xe2\x80\x99s premium hatch continues to get buyers into the brand\xe2\x80\x99s showrooms. However, we\xe2\x80\x99re not here to sing hymns of its praise. We take a close look at the Elite i20 and tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s hot and what\xe2\x80\x99s not.Dual airbags standard across all variants.The 1.4-litre diesel engine gives you quite the drive with a great gearbox adding a cherry on top.Fantastic exterior styling.1.2-litre petrol is underwhelming.ABS restricted to the mid and top variants.Tall and husky people may feel confined within the limited cabin area.Projector headlamps.The new AVN system with Bluetooth.The Elite i20 is a great blend of style, quality, features and function. It\xe2\x80\x99s not as spacious as the Baleno or Jazz, not is the petrol powertrain as engaging to use as the Swift. However, the fit and finish quality is impeccable and the Elite\xe2\x80\x99s trim quality levels are a benchmark. There\xe2\x80\x99s a good amount of features on offer too and let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget, the car looks fantastic too."The Elite i20 is a great all-rounder and makes for a great buy."'
