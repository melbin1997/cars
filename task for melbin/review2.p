On an average, the vehicle can reach a top speed of around 145kmph, and can reach the 100kmph mark within 15 seconds.Ed's take:  The fuel efficiency of the Indigo eCS is something that Tata Motors has been boasting about. As per the ARAI cycle, they get a fuel economy of 25kmpl. In the real world it will be lesser, but more than most of the competition. The upgraded eCS still has that. And now you even have the cost effective CNG variant too. The CR4 diesel engine delivers a mileage of 22kmpl on city roads and 25kmpl on highways. As for the TDi diesel engine, a mileage of 13.6kmpl on city roads is achieved, with 18.3kmpl for highways. As for the petrol variant, the MPFi engine delivers a mileage of 15kmpl for city limits, and 18kmpl for highways.The vehicle comes with three engine variants, of which two are diesel and one is petrol. The first diesel trim is a common rail CR4 engine. This mill produces a maximum power of 69hp along with a peak torque of 140Nm. The second diesel trim is a 1405cc TDi engine that can churn out 69hp of power and 135Nm of torque. The petrol version houses a 1.2-litre mill that generates a power of 64hp in combination with a peak torque of 100Nm.Ed's take:  The eCS comes with music system that supports Bluetooth connectivity and also gets power windows.

The front brakes are fitted with ventilated discs, while the rear brakes have drums. The suspension system is also of good standard. The front axle of the chassis is equipped with independent McPherson strut with coil spring. The rear axle has an independent 3-link McPherson strut with anti roll bar. In addition to this, the handling is also made smoother with the aid of an anti lock braking system. The steering is a rack and pinion based system with collapsible steering column.Ed's take:  The safety features on the Indigo eCS include airbags and ABS. The vehicle provides tight seatbelts for its passengers. In addition to this, it has double barrel headlamps that provide optimum visibility.

S"After introducing the Abarth 500 model, Fiat India has now rolled two more products in the country powered by Abarth. One of these is the much hyped Fiat Punto Abarth , which is a hatchback. It is based on the same platform on which, the Punto Evo is designed. This version draws power from the 1.4-litre T-Jet petrol engine, which is also under the hood of its Linea sedan. However, the firm has attuned this power plant to increase its output to 145bhp, which is insane for 1368cc mill. This helps the vehicle to travel 1 kilometer in just 30.4 seconds only. This is perhaps the only engine option that the company is offering for now. It looks pretty much alike the existing hatchback model, but the exclusive cosmetic package distinguishes it from the rest. Even after having the brand Abarth characteristics, it has been introduced at a very competitive price tag enabling it to give tough times for the likes of Volkswagen Polo GT TSI. There is no wonder if this powerful hatchback gains the upper hand over the others, since it has everything to meet the requirements of power-starved enthusiasts in India. This is perhaps the first car in the sub 10-lakh segment to have disc braking mechanism for all wheels, which balances its immense power capabilities.\n\nAs we can see through the images, there are quite a few cosmetic add-ons given to its exteriors like body decals and signature alloy wheels and other sporty features. The interiors are in black color scheme highlighted by ambient lighting scheme on the dashboard. Adding to this, the analogue gauges have red dials that further emphasizes its sporty aura. As for the features, this model gets all the facilities and equipment borrowed from Punto EVO hatchback along with a few other add-ons.

Accompanied with these are the connectivity features like Bluetooth, USB and AUX-In which enhances the conveniences inside.There are several plus points about this vehicle and its external styling is certainly its key highlight. Although, it looks to be the same like its sibling hatchback, its brand Abarth's cosmetic package is what renders it a outstanding look. Currently, this hatchback is available in black and white exterior paint options. Additionally, its body is decorated with red colored decals that enhances its dynamic appeal. This is indeed a perfect color combination for any vehicle in the sports arena. To begin with the side profile, its door panels have these decals in the lower section with Abarth lettering on it. Here, the door handles are painted in body color, while outside rear view mirrors are in dual color (red and black). They are also integrated with side turn indicator for added elegance and safety. The neatly crafted wheel arches are mated to a set of signature alloy wheels, which have 'Abarth' emblem on them.

The bumper below has a smaller air intake section, but the fog lamp console are big and has a thick metallic surround. Its overall look is complimented by the 'Abarth' logo, which is positioned on top of the hood.\n\nExterior Measurements:\n\nAs expected, this hatchback is introduced in the sub 4-meter segment with a total length measuring 3989mm. It has a width of 1687mm and a total height of about 1505mm. Its minimum ground clearance is just about 155mm. However, the overall wheelbase of this hatchback is 2510mm, which is good enough for having comfortable cabin space.This \xe2\x80\x9chottest hatch\xe2\x80\x9d of India (as stated by the company), can certainly impress customers with its attractive interiors.

Furthermore, the aspects such as electric boot release, large glove box compartment, tilt adjustable steering wheel and electrically adjustable outside mirrors assist in improving the comfort levels to a great extent.\n\nInterior Measurements:\n\nThe dimensions seem to be just perfect with ample head and shoulder room. The leg space too looks very sufficient. The boot volume is also good and the rear seat aids in making more room for luggage.After going through its power figures, we can expect that this vehicle to be good at acceleration. The manufacturer claims that the vehicle can accelerate from 0 to 100 Kmph mark in mere 8.8 seconds and can travel from 0 to 1 kilometer in just 30.4 seconds only. As for maximum speed, it can clock about 180 to 190 Kmph.As we expected earlier, this latest hatchback has arrived with a 1.4-litre, T-Jet petrol engine fitted under its bonnet. This is a turbocharged motor, which is coupled with a 5-speed manual transmission gear box that distributes power to its front wheels. This drive train comprises of 4-cylinders and 16-valves altogether making a total displacement capacity of 1368cc. It is also incorporated with a multi point fuel injection system for optimum power output and performance. It has the ability to churn out a maximum power of 145bhp at 5500rpm and yields a peak torque output of 212Nm between 2000 to 4000rpm. This mill is claimed to return a fuel economy of about 16.13 Kmpl.This sensational product draws the power from a 1.4-litre T-Jet petrol engine, whose capabilities are boosted to improve power output. However, this doesn't seem to have affected its fuel efficiency, as it is claimed to give a mileage of approximately 16.3 Kmpl (as per ARAI).Like mentioned above, the Italian automobile firm has tuned this 1368cc power plant enabling it to generate more power. As a result of this, it is able to churn out 145bhp of maximum power along with 212Nm of hammering torque.Packed with this powerful hatchback is a sophisticated in-car entertainment that comprises of various equipment.

As for the front axle, there is an independent wheel type of suspension accompanied with torsion beam suspension at the rear. Both the axles are further loaded with helical coil springs and double acting telescopic dampers and stabilizer bars for making the drive jerk-free. As for the braking, all the four wheels have been assembled with a robust set of disc brakes, which are necessary for this powerful hatch. This mechanism is assisted by the anti lock braking system and electronic brake force distribution, which makes cornering stress-free and more safe. Also, it has a hydraulic power assisted steering column that is good at offering response, depending upon the speed level.This Italian automaker seems to have packed this stunner with some crucial safety function to guarantee a secure ride to its passengers.
