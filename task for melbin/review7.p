S'Hyundai Creta'
p1
S"IntroductionHyundai has always been ahead of the game in understanding and gauging the market and coming out with the right product at the right time. For example, the premium hatch segment was captured really well by Hyundai with the help of the i20.The mini SUV market is taking over the hatchback market. Hyundai failed to gauge the change. They made stop-gap arrangements by putting their hatch, the i20, on stilts. This gave birth to the i20 Active. The pseudo-crossover fooled no one and they needed something more concrete to challenge the Renault Duster. Then began the process of bringing the ix25, already being sold in China, to India. The ix25 is based on the i20 platform and shares its engine options with the Verna. It\xe2\x80\x99s been rebadged as the Creta for India. Is it really \xe2\x80\x9cThe perfect SUV\xe2\x80\x9d as Hyundai claims it to be? We find out!Pros:1. Well-proportioned and smart looking SUV, based on Hyundai\xe2\x80\x99s Fluidic 2.0 design.\n2. High levels of engine refinement and comfortable ride quality in city driving conditions.\n3. Well tuned suspension. Does not feel \xe2\x80\x98bouncy\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98twitchy\xe2\x80\x99 like most Hyundais.Cons:1. Could have been priced more aggressively. Fails to justify the price point.\n2. No AWD/4x4 option available, limiting its off-road capabilities.\n3. No Petrol Automatic option on offer.\n4. Diesel automatic & Petrol variant not available in the Top-End trim. Misses out on curtain airbags, 17\xe2\x80\x9d rims and faux leather interiors. \n5. Instrument Cluster does not show fuel efficiency and distance to empty. Something that we expected from Hyundai at this price point.\n \nStand Out Features:6. The snappy 7\xe2\x80\x9d infotainment system with navigation.\n7. High safety levels. Offered with an option for 6 Airbags, Electronic Stability Program. Fared will in China\xe2\x80\x99s crash tests too. \n8. Diesel Automatic on offer.Overview:Hyundai is managing to create quite a lot of pre-launch buzz around their cars. The Creta too had its share of the limelight. With its \xe2\x80\x98Perfect SUV Claims\xe2\x80\x99, urban SUV design along with Hyundai\xe2\x80\x99s signature dish i.e  a long list of equipment levels, it is sure to make the Renault Duster a little scared. It\xe2\x80\x99s now on offer with three engine options (2 Diesel & 1 Petrol) and a Diesel automatic spread out across 6 trim levels. Hyundai has tried to tick as many users as possible with these combinations and everyone from a city commuter to a highway muncher can find a Creta of their choice. \nExterior:The Creta, without a second thought, is the best looking car in its segment. The Renault Duster is ageing fast and the tall stance of the Ford Ecosport is not as well-proportioned as the Creta. The Creta is based on Hyundai Fluidic 2.0 design philosophy. It is a mini Santa Fe of sorts. The car has neat lines and elegant bulges where required. Overall the styling is aggressive, a good character trait to have in an SUV.On the front, you are greeted by the three slats of chrome and a zealous pair of headlamps. The chrome sits in the characteristic Hyundai hexagonal grills. The headlamps are a busy unit which house the daytime running lights at the bottom, a large projector lamp unit, turn indicator and the cornering lamps. The bumper is large and houses vertical fog lamps and a bogus silver skid plate. You will find the fake skid plate at the back too.On the side, the 17-inch diamond cut alloys immediately catch your eye. The fit well in the wheel arches. Only the top spec diesel manual offers the 17-inch rims, all other variants have to make do with 16-incher. The rims are wrapped by 215mm of rubber, same as the Duster. The car has a continuous skirt of black cladding. A neat line runs from the top of the front wheel arch to the tail lamp at the back. Another line runs on top of the black cladding from one wheel arch to another. The car gets a neat pair of roof rails. They are purely cosmetic and cannot be used for loading luggage onto the roof. They give the car a few extra mm in height aiding with the SUV stance.Moving to the back, the design is minimalistic with a trip of chrome housed above the number plate area. It gets split tail lamps and a couple of long, horizontal reflectors on the bulgy bumper. The bumper gets similar faux plastic skid plate treatment as the front.In terms of dimensions, the Creta\xe2\x80\x99s length is 4270 mm which is 45mm lower than the Duster and 30mm lower than the S-Cross. It is a good 270mm larger than the Ecosport which is just below 4 meters to take advantage of the sub-4m tax benefits. Creta\xe2\x80\x99s width of 1780mm is 42 mm behind Dusters 1822 mm.While the Renault Duster looks more like a typical SUV with its macho looks the Creta looks at home in the urban environment. The design of the Creta, just like the Ecosport, feels out of place in the off-road environment.  Interior:Interiors have always been a really strong point for Hyundai. The interiors of the Creta is dominant by black. There is beige on the dash that runs from one door pad to another and onto the doors. The fit and finish are top notch, something that is typical of modern Hyundai\xe2\x80\x99s.At the centre of the dash is a 7\xe2\x80\x9d touch screen In-Car entertainment system with navigation. The lower variant is offered sans the navigation system, but you get 1GB of onboard storage for your media. You can use Bluetooth, USB or Aux as inputs for the media. It is a snappy unit and easy to navigate around its features. At the top is a small digital clock integrated into the dash. On either side of the touchscreen are vertical air-con vents. These vents are surrounded by chrome inserts.At the bottom are the controls for the climate control system. A nice touch is the mood bar that moves from blue to red depending on the temperature that you have set. The air conditioning unit is powerful and is aided by the presence of the vents at the rear.Ahead of the gear lever is a nice large storage area lined with an anti-slip material coupled with slots for the power socket, AUX & USB. The AUX and USB slots get no cover but have a blue illumination to aid with finding the slot.The steering wheel is a leatherette-wrapped unit with useful thumb contours. The steering wheel tilt (rake) can be adjusted but misses out on reach adjustment. This is a let-down as this feature is available on the i20 but Hyundai has missed out on inculcating it here. However, the wheel is neutrally placed and most people can find a comfortable position. The buttons on the steering wheel are a combination of buttons and switches. The left ones control the infotainment system whereas the controls on the right control the instrument console.The instrument cluster is clean with two identically sized dials for the tachometer (Rev-Counter) and speedometer. Digital temperature and fuel gauges are inculcated into the same dials. At the center is the MID (Multi Information Display). This shows two trip computers which also show distance travelled, average speed and trip time in respect to that trip. The computer misses out to show fuel economy or distance to empty, which we feel is a must have for a car of its segment.The other readouts are traction control & stability control status, key not in vehicle warning, gear shift indicator, outside temperature and the parking sensor display. The stalks on either side of the steering are dependable units in terms of quality. The left houses control for the front & rear wipers. The right stalk controls the turn indicators and controls for the headlamps & fog lamps.On the dash, on the driver's left is the start stop button and on the right are control switches for traction control, instrument cluster illumination and headlamps levelling to set the throw of the headlamps. The key less system is a really smart unit which not only detects the presence of the key in the vicinity but also detects if it is inside or outside the cabin. You can access the car by a request sensor on the driver's side door. Just click the black button and it detects if the key is around to unlock the car. There is no need to pull the key out of your pocket. Once you are in, just hit the clutch with the start-stop button to bring the car to life.The wing mirrors are electrically controlled and foldable from the console on the door. The power window controls are on the door armrest along with the central locking control. The door houses the front speaker and has ample storage space with provision to store a 1L bottles.The glove-box is neither illuminated nor cooled. It is made of hard plastic and does not have a lining either.Moving to the top, the sun visors again are a let down in terms of quality for the price tag the Creta commands. Passenger side visor gets a vanity mirror without illumination and the driver side visor gets a simple strap for a ticket holder. The cabin lights at the front are two individual units separated by the switch and Bluetooth mic. The sunglass holder in integrated into the same unit.The seats are covered in black fake leather with white stitching which have a rich feeling to them. The lower variants get a fabric treatment to the seats. The seats are comfortable and the driver seat can be adjusted for height. Finding a driving position is easy and headroom is ample. However, we found the shoulder room to be on the lower side.Moving to the rear, the seats continue to get the same treatment as the front. There is ample leg room and the seating position is relaxed. This may translate to strain on your lower back during the longer drives but is not much of an issue. There is a centre armrest with cup holders. Even though the floor hump  is really small, we found that the rear seats are more suitable for 2 adults as opposed to 3. You get two large adjustable headrests, rear air-con vents and a charging point.However, because of the design of the car, you get small rear windows which makes visibility for the rear passengers difficult. This also contributes to a claustrophobic feeling at the back.\nWhen you go all the way back, the boot stands at 400 litres. This is smaller than the dusters 475 litres. While this is ample space for the weekend trips, more space can be made by dropping the rear seats which fall down flat. Well, almost flat.  We feel the fit and finish along with the quality of interior are exactly where they need to be with a car in this segment, but we expect more from Hyundai and there are many features that have been missed out that are already available on lower variants. As a Hyundai, the Creta fails to justify its higher price tag.PerformancePetrol:The petrol engine on Creta is the 1.6L VTVT unit carried over from Verna. This engine churns out 121bhp of power and 151Nm of torque. This puts it at the top of Ecosport\xe2\x80\x99s 110bhp and Duster\xe2\x80\x99s 103bhp. The Creta Petrol is on offer with two gearbox options. A 6 speed AT and a 6 speed MT. As we haven't had the chance to get out hands on the automatic, we're reserving our impressions to the manual.The petrol engine feels lethargic. The power is available at the top the rev range and needs to be pushed hard to extract its best. When we drove it on the highway, overtaking usually involved going down a gear to complete the overtake manoeuvre.  At higher RPMs the engine sound does make its way into the cabin. This is not very harsh and pleased our petrol head ears. The engine is mated to a 6-Speed manual gearbox. You have no option for an automatic here.The ARAI rating for the petrol stands at 15.29kmpl, but our car touched the 11kmpl on the test. The petrol is a perfect option as a city runabout. If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a heavier usage, you will have to look at the Creta\xe2\x80\x99s diesel line-up.Diesel:The Creta is offered with two Diesel engine options. A 1.4L CRDi and a larger 1.6L CRDi. The first 3 variants offer the 1.4L engine and the top 3 variants offer the 1.6L engine.1.4L CRDiThe engine, which is also found in the i20 makes 89bhp of power and 220Nm of torque. This is mated to a 6-Speed unit. The engine has good low-end torque making it well suited for snail pace moving city traffic. While it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t instil confidence on the Highways as the 1.6 does, it won\xe2\x80\x99t disappoint either.As the 1.4 is only on offer for the bottom 3 variants, the option best for the budget conscious who still want the SUV style vehicle in their garage. The engine is suitable for the city condition and the occasional intercity run.1.6L CRDiOne of the best things about the 1.6 CRDi Creta is the refinement levels of the engine. The engine sets into a smooth idle once started. It is derived from the Verna and churns out 126bhp of power which is ahead of the 108 bhp offered by the Duster and 99 bhp offered by the Ecosport.The engine has evident turbo lag up to the 1900rpm mark which is followed by smooth power delivery. The high torque figures translates to fewer downshifts. The gearbox is mated to a light clutch. While the light clutch is a plus, the higher travel of the clutch can get irritating in stop-and-go traffic.The engine comes to light in highway driving conditions. The engine runs 100+ speeds without making a fuss and munches miles with ease. Somehow, the engine feels more at home here than on the Verna.Ride & Handling:One of the stand-out features of the Creta is its ride and handling. The way that the Creta soaks up road bumps and undulations is truly a class apart. Even with the kind of weight, it carries, the body roll is in check. While the car is not meant to be driven hard around corners, the car does behave well when thrown into a corner.The steering, again, is an excellent job by Hyundai. The system is one of the best amongst all they Hyundai\xe2\x80\x99s on offer. At low speeds, the steering is light and effortless. This is a boon for city driving. The steering weights up better than any other Hyundai at highway speeds and shows that Hyundai is trying to head in the right direction as far as steering response in concerned.Safety:In the Creta, ABS is offered as a standard across all variants. The Creta is a great option for someone looking for a safe car. The top end SX(O) variant is offered with 6 airbags, traction control, Electronic stability program and hill-start assist.The Creta is constructed using advanced high-strength steel and ultra high-strength steel. This keeps the weight low as well as enhances passenger protection in case of a collision. This claim was proved when the Creta (Called the ix25 in China) underwent the C-NCAP (China New Car Assessment Program) and scored a full 5 stars. Point to be noted is that the tests were conducted on the mid-range (S+) variant without curtain airbags.Variants:The Creta is offered in 3 engine options (1 Petrol & 2 Diesel) option.\nThe 1.6 petrol engine is offered in 3 variants. Base, S & SX+. The smaller, 1.4 diesel engine is offered in the bottom three variants of Base, S & S+. The 1.6 diesel is offered in the top three trims of SX, SX+ & SX(O). The option for an automatic is only offered with the S+ & SX+ for the diesel while the petrol automatic is only offered with the SX+. The petrol Creta is perfect for the short office shuttles. You can get it in the SX+ trim as the SX(O) is not offered with the petrol. In case your use involves the occasional highway stint, you could go for the Diesel automatic that is offered only in the SX+ trim. In case, if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for the fully loaded trim, your only engine option will be the 1.6 diesel manual. This certainly is our pick of the lot as the variant is is high on safety features and offers premium additions such as the 17-inch alloys and the leather upholstery.Verdict:If you like to have a bit of off-road fun and the Thar is too uncivilised for you, the Duster AWD will do well on the beaten path. On the other hand, if you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for an SUV and will spend most of your time on paved roads, look no further as the Creta is the best option. The claims by Hyundai about the Creta being \xe2\x80\x98The Perfect SUV\xe2\x80\x99 is a long shot due to the lack of a 4WD option, the Creta is certainly the perfect companion for the urban jungle.
