S'Hyundai Verna'
p1
S'The Hyundai Verna was supposed to replace the Hyundai Accent in 2006. However, Hyundai decided to sell both cars side by side and the 1st generation of the Verna was born. In its first avatar, its design was a bit of an acquired taste and didn\xe2\x80\x99t find too many takers. A few facelifts later, the Fluidic Verna came into existence. The design was well received, the feature list was large and the car was priced well. In a time when the segment was ruled by the Honda City, this car shook things up to temporarily take the top spot. Honda had a trick up their sleeve and introduced the diesel variant, taking back the City\xe2\x80\x99s crown. In a bid to win back market share, the Hyundai Verna 4S has been released. Does it still have what it takes to threaten the City?One of the best-looking sedan in the segment. The futuristic fluidic design is quite a stunner.Loaded with features: projector headlamps with daytime running lamps, keyless entry etc.Offered with one of the most power diesel engine in the segment. The 1.6 litre diesel offers 126 bhp and 260Nm of torque.No AC vents at the rear. Much cheaper Grandi10 gets it!Bouncy suspension. Passengers get thrown about over broken roads.Rear seats lack under-thigh support and rear passenger headroom is abysmal.Ergo Lever. It is one of the best features on offer and will be loved by chauffeur driven customers. One of the safest cars in the segment. Offered with an option of up to 6 airbags, ABS & ESP.The Hyundai Verna is a well-loaded package and offers a lot of unique features. The car\xe2\x80\x99s features, neutral handling characteristics and Hyundai\xe2\x80\x99s good after-sales network make it a safe, but well-packaged option that is in some ways, even better than the Creta."If you want a driver\xe2\x80\x99s car though, we recommend looking at a European alternative."The diesel Verna is a better than the Honda City, while the petrols are closely matched. If you want a driver\xe2\x80\x99s car though, we recommend looking at a European alternative.'
